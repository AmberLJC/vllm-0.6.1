At this point, the linker knows the exact sizes of the code and data sections in its input object modules. It is now ready to begin the relocation step, where it merges the input modules and assigns run-time addresses to each symbol. Relocation consists of two steps:\n\nRelocating sections and symbol definitions. In this step, the linker merges all sections of the same type into a new aggregate section of the same type. For example, the .data sections from the input modules are all merged into one section that will become the .data section for the output executable object file. The linker then assigns run-time memory addresses to the new aggregate sections, to each section defined by the input modules, and to each symbol defined by the input modules. When this step is complete, each instruction and global variable in the program has a unique run-time memory address.\n\nRelocating symbol references within sections. In this step, the linker modifies every symbol reference in the bodies of the code and data sections so that they point to the correct run-time addresses. To perform this step, the linker relies on data structures in the relocatable object modules known as relocation entries, which we describe next.",

It's a tool for programmers to build personal or team automation without dealings with APIs directly.\n\nMembrane is like an operating system in that the user runs programs on it. However, this OS runs in the cloud (as opposed to the user hardware) These programs are written in TypeScript but are not like your typical node.js program.\n\nMembrane programs cannot directly open files or make network requests. Instead, they can only interact with the world via graph nodes. You're in complete control of who can access what nodes. The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction with many benefits that I'm personally only beginning to understand.\n\nIt's through these nodes that programs make HTTP requests, send emails, or access APIs.\n\nThe graph guarantees that programs (especially the ones you didn't write) can only do what they say they do, and not, for example, exfiltrate data.\n\nThe graph is explorable and type-safe. Anything is referenceable, so access to data can be very fine-grained.\n\nThe nodes in the graph provide a capabilities-based access model in that programs cannot forge a reference to a node. These references are called grefs.\n\nGrefs are analogous to URLs but for your graph. They are also strongly typed. The syntax for grefs looks like \"pid:path.to.node\" where pid can be the name or id of the program.\n\nAny path segment can also have parameters. Parameters are passed enclosed in parentheses like so \"pid:path.to(param:value).node(param:value)\". Multiple parameters can be provided to a segment by separating them with a comma.\n\nParameter values use the same syntax as GraphQL scalar literals: strings must be enclosed in double quotes, while integers, floats, booleans and null don't require double quotes.\n\nGrefs can also nest other grefs as a parameter, that way you can compose functionality together. To pass a nested gref, enclose its value in parentheses.\n\nCan you think of a few gref examples in your hypothetical Membrane account which has programs to access github, twitter and Jira?.",

South Korea announced on Monday that it plans to launch its own sixth-generation (6G) network in 2028. As part of the K-Network 2030 plan, South Korea will secure \"world-class\" 6G technologies, innovate the \"software-based next-generation mobile network\" and strengthen the network supply chain.\n\nSimultaneously, the government will incentivize local companies to produce equipment, parts, and materials for 6G technology in South Korea. It will also develop an open radio access network that is compatible with any device and enables mobile carriers and enterprises to provide flexible services.\n\nTo make all of these possible, South Korea is conducting a feasibility study for a research and development project on core 6G technologies. The project is worth 625.3 billion won (~US$482 million).\n\nAccording to the country's Ministry of Science and ICT, the country is carrying out these efforts in a bid to secure an early dominance of the future wireless frequencies. The plan is also aimed at helping the country retain its position in the global competition for future network infrastructure. A report by IP intelligence company IPlytics found that while 4G technology development was mostly dominated by U.S. and European companies, South Korean companies took the lead in 5G development.\n\nWhat's more, South Korea accounted for 25.9% of the number of 5G patents last year. It aims to reach 30% or over in the 6G patent competition.\n\nAside from South Korea, India also aims to launch 6G services before the end of this decade. The South Asian company already has a task force working to achieve the goal.",

Entry by a major firm thus often produces a new ball game, not only with new key players but also with new rules for competing. Similarly, exit of a major firm changes the competitive structure by reducing the number of market leaders and increasing the dominance of the leaders who remain. \n\u2022 Diffusion of technical know-how across companies and countries. As knowledge about how to perform a particular activity or execute a particular manufacturing technol- ogy spreads, products tend to become more commodity-like. Knowledge diffusion can occur through scientific journals, trade publications, onsite plant tours, word of mouth among suppliers and customers, employee migration, and Internet sources. \n\u2022 Changes in cost and efficiency. Widening or shrinking differences in the costs among key competitors tend to dramatically alter the state of competition. Declining costs of producing tablets have enabled price cuts and spurred tablet sales (especially lower-priced models) by making them more affordable to lower-income households worldwide. Lower cost e-books are cutting into sales of costlier hardcover books as increasing numbers of consumers have laptops, iPads, Kindles, and other brands of tablets. \n\u2022 Reductions in uncertainty and business risk. Many companies are hesitant to enter industries with uncertain futures or high levels of business risk because it is unclear how much time and money it will take to overcome various technological hurdles and achieve acceptable production costs (as is the case in the solar power indus- try). Over time, however, diminishing risk levels and uncertainty tend to stimulate new entry and capital investments on the part of growth-minded companies seeking new opportunities, thus dramatically altering industry and competitive conditions. \n\u2022 Regulatory influences and government policy changes. Government regulatory actions can often mandate significant changes in industry practices and strategic approaches\u2014as has recently occurred in the world\u2019s banking industry. New rules and regulations pertaining to government-sponsored health insurance programs are driving changes in the health care industry. In international markets, host gov- ernments can drive competitive changes by opening their domestic markets to for- eign participation or closing them to protect domestic companies. \n\u2022 Changing societal concerns, attitudes, and lifestyles. Emerging social issues as well as changing attitudes and lifestyles can be powerful instigators of industry change. Growing concern about the effects of climate change has emerged as a major driver of change in the energy industry. Concerns about the use of chemical additives and the nutritional content of food products have been driving changes in the restaurant and food industries. Shifting societal concerns, attitudes, and lifestyles alter the pattern of competition, favoring those players that respond with products targeted to the new trends and conditions.",

Our interview-to-hire ratio is industry-leading and, in many cases, an order of magnitude better.\n\nHigher developer retention\nCompanies using an Intelligent Talent Cloud also have excellent retention. For example, our developer engagement success rate is 97% which means 97% of the time, when you take a developer from Turing, they\u2019ll stay with you and get the job done, leading to the successful completion of the project. Most of our engagements get renewed with the same developers, which leads to continuity for our customers.\n\nTuring has over a million developers signed up.\nOver a million developers from 140 countries have already joined Turing\u2019s Intelligent Talent Cloud representing a wide variety of job types, including full-stack, front end, back end, mobile, AI, data science, DevOps, and more. \n\nOur Intelligent Talent Cloud hosts highly-skilled developers capable of working with over 100 different technologies, including React, Node, Angular, Python, Java, and C sharp. \n\nOur core engineering team, which comes from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber, and other top technology companies, has defined a Facebook and Google-style engineering ladder. This ladder helps hiring managers to identify engineers at the seniority level they need. \n\nWhy developers prefer Turing\u2019s Talent Cloud\nTuring offers developers careers, not gigs. Our developers love Turing because they want to build a career while being remote. They get flexibility while solving critical engineering problems with the best companies in the world. At Turing, they get to progress in their career, learn, and grow.\n\nWhy would an engineer accept ultra-rigorous vetting?\nEngineers get vetted once and become eligible for lifelong matching with some of the world\u2019s most admired companies in the US and the world. Because they amortize the time they spend going through vetting across thousands of exciting jobs, they are comfortable doing this.",

The header row is formatted using the maximum length of the subset label in the `rminfo` dictionary.

After each rewriting, I want you to clearly explain any revisions you made.\nA KMD with a transmission ratio near 100% could be misunderstood as an essential gene (Fig 1A). To seek for potential KMDs lurking in the genome of S. pombe, we investigated the disagreement between homozygous and heterozygous deletion analysis from previous datasets (data S1). mug135 (meiotically upregulated gene) was previously annotated \u2018essential\u2019 since mug135\u0394 haploid offspring from mug135(+)/mug135\u0394 are inviable(16). However, no meiotic defect was reported for mug135\u0394/mug135\u0394(17,18), raising mug135 a potential selfish KMD. We independently deleted mug135 in the haploid lab strain and observed no overt defect. Diploids lacking both mug135 copies also exhibited normal spore viability (Fig. 1B). However, mug135(+)/mug135\u0394 heterozygotes mainly give rise to a 2:2 pattern and the viable colonies are almost always mug135(+) (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that mug135 is actually a KMD, dispensable when homozygous, while skewing transmission ratio in heterozygotes. According to this characteristic, we renamed mug135 as tdk1 (transmission-distorting killer). \n\ntdk1 locates on the left arm of chromosome III and contains a single 1074-nt-long open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1C and fig. S1). Through inspecting the Illunima sequencing data of 161 natural isolates, we found that tdk1 has fixed in all these natural strains(19). Since the repeat region in the middle is challenging to assemble and seems versatile, we constructed a haplotype tree of tdk1 from 56 typical haploid strain according to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the non-repeat region. There are eight haplotypes in total, forming three main types\u2014one including tdk1from lab strain, one containing six nonsynonymous mutations (S65A, R102K, E230D, I235M, R255K and D288E) and the other with three nonsynonymous mutations (K50R, D241Y and G319E) (hereafter referred to as tdk1(6SNP) and tdk1(3SNP)) (fig. S2A). We picked two strains of tdk1(6SNP) type and two of tdk1(3SNP), manipulated them into heterothallic, and found that neither tdk1(6SNP) in JB939 or JB953 is able to distort transmission ratio (fig. S2B). Nevertheless, both tdk1(3SNP) from JB1180 and JB1206 are still active killers (fig. S2C). We then introduced these six mutations into lab strain and found that tdk1(6SNP) is not an active killer in reference strain, but shows resistance to killing by tdk1 (Fig. 2A). In other words, the six nonsynonymous mutations of tdk1(6SNP) from natural populations has rendered tdk1 a resistant type.\n\nTo study the molecular mechanism of tdk1, we ectopically integrated plasmids containing tdk1 gene under its endogenous promoter into tdk1\u0394 strain. tdk1 inserted at ade6 locus on the right arm of chromosome III or leu1 locus on chromosome II both distort transmission ratio efficiently (Fig. 1, C and D). The observation that no specific target locus is required for killing action of tdk1 and the locus-independent manner point to the poison-antidote model. When the start-codon was mutated, tdk1 became incapable of killing siblings with no tdk1 insertion and fails to resist the toxicity from tdk1 (Fig. 1D). Additively, codon-scrambled tdk1 driven by the promoter of another meiotically upregulated gene and terminated by the terminator of a constitutive gene (mug24p-tdk1(SCR)-ADH1t) also distort transmission ratio efficiently (fig. S3A), and no in-frame isoform was detected by western blotting against Tdk1 (fig. S3, B and C), ruling out the participation of transcripts other than Tdk1 polypeptide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tdk1 is a single-gene selfish killer, and the same Tdk1 polypeptide performs both as a poison and antidote. \n\nInterestingly, tdk1(+) and tdk1\u0394 spores from tdk1(+)/tdk1\u0394 are indistinguishable and germinate properly, differing from \u2018spore killers\u2019 which disable spores (Fig. 1, F and G, movies S1 and S2). A selective germination system was designed to examine the respective phenotype of tdk1(+) and tdk1\u0394 cells during spore germination (fig. S4A). Live-cell imaging revealed that although tdk1\u0394 spores germinate normally, 80.6% of them displayed severe defect during the first mitosis after germination. Chromosome segregation of tdk1\u0394 cells is largely hindered, leading to high level of nuclear displacement (61.2%) or \"cut\" phenotype (19.4%) (Fig. 1, F and G, movies S1 and S2). These results suggest that tdk1kills non-carrier siblings by preventing chromosome segregation during developmental growth rather than by disabling spores.",

        "prompt": "this is my initial spec:\n\nTitle: HPI Service Design Technical Specification\n\nOverview:\nThis technical specification describes the design of the HPI service, a Java-based component that performs business logic for the USTLO module. The HPI service is responsible for managing a network connections model and communicating with USTLO using bi-directional messages in a custom format.\n\nFunctionality:\nThe HPI service performs the following functions:\n\nReceives messages from USTLO\nUpdates the network connections model based on the received messages\nTriggers business logic conditions as necessary\nSends commands to USTLO via messages in response to triggered business logic conditions\nCommunication Protocol:\nThe HPI service communicates with USTLO using a custom bi-directional message format. Messages contain mandatory parameters in a fixed part followed by a list of optional parameters in TLV format. The message type and length are included in the first four bytes of the message, followed by the number of TLVs and the fixed part. The TLV section is divided into the number of TLVs in the header and the list of TLVs after the fixed part.\n\nModel:\nThe HPI service stores a model of network connections in a module called \"model\". The model is updated based on the messages received from USTLO and contains the following data:\n\nSession manager: Maps client IP addresses to client sessions\nClient session: Stores client profiles and a mapping from ports to client connections named \"flow params\"\nFlow params: Stores connection metadata\nConnections (flow params) can be grouped into related connection groups based on criteria such as playback\nFlows:\nA client session starts when the client goes online and ends when the HPI receives notification of the end of the session or enough time has passed. During the session, connections are created and destroyed, and metadata can be updated from USTLO and other services. When a session or connection ends, details are logged in a transaction log.\n\nService Level Agreements:\nThe HPI service should meet the following service level agreements:\n\nAvailability: The HPI service should be available for use by all USTLO workers at all times. The service should be scaled as needed and monitored for health and capacity. In the event of a failure, a new instance of the service will be started as soon as possible. However, it should be noted that a failure of an HPI service can cause the loss of live session and connection data, which may result in default behavior from USTLO.\nResponse Time: The HPI service should respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe, taking into account the processing time for both the HPI service and USTLO.\nError Handling: The HPI service should handle errors and exceptions gracefully and log them for debugging purposes. The service should not propagate errors to USTLO and should be able to handle situations where it receives messages mid-flow.\nCompliance: The HPI service must comply with all relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA.\nI would like to work on this specification and enhance it, my main focus is detailed description of the underlying architecture and model used. \n\nyour job is to ask me a list of questions that will help me make this spec more robust and detailed \n\n-- here is some additional information \n\nComponents and Interactions:\n\nThe HPI service interacts with the following components:\n\nUSTLO: a high throughput proxy that acts as an entry point for network connections. The HPI service provides business logic to USTLO for managing network connections and communication with other services.\nSPM: a service that provides the HPI service with user profiles, which are used for session management and connection metadata.\nCEMS: a central configuration service that is used to configure all services, including the HPI service.\nSharding and User Sessions:\n\nThe HPI service runs as a sharded cluster, where each HPI instance deals with a subsection of clients connecting to the network through the USTLO proxy. The USTLO proxy is responsible for sharding the users between the available HPIs and notifying the same HPI about events of the same user. Specifically, events about the same user (based on its source IP) should only arrive at one HPI for the duration of the user session.\n\nArchitecture and Design:\n\nThe sharding of the HPI service enables scalability and fault tolerance, as each HPI instance can handle a subset of users and can be independently monitored and scaled. The communication between the HPI service and the other components is based on a custom message format and includes authentication, encryption, and access controls to ensure security and compliance with regulations.\n\nThe SPM service provides user profiles that include information such as user credentials, preferences, and metadata related to the network connections. This information is used by the HPI service to manage user sessions and connection metadata, which are stored in the network connections model. The CEMS service provides configuration information for the HPI service, including parameters such as the maximum message size, supported data types, and error handling mechanisms.\n\nThe sharding and user session management of the HPI service ensure that each HPI instance only receives and processes events related to a subset of users, reducing the processing load and avoiding duplication of events. The HPI service is designed to handle failures and errors gracefully and log them for debugging purposes. Performance metrics and monitoring mechanisms are used to evaluate the performance and health of the HPI service and its interactions with other components.\n-- and some more information \n\nThe USTLO high throughput proxy is a single service that uses multiple workers, each bound to a CPU, to handle network connections. The use of multiple workers ensures that the traffic of a connected client is directed to the same worker, providing consistency and reducing the overhead of communication between workers. The workers are designed to be completely independent from each other, allowing for scalability and fault tolerance.\n\nThe USTLO service includes a dispatcher that routes client packets to the appropriate worker, based on the client's source IP address. This ensures that traffic from a connected client is directed to the same worker throughout the duration of the session, improving performance and reducing latency. The dispatcher also supports load balancing and failover mechanisms, allowing for dynamic allocation of client traffic to available workers.\n\nThe USTLO service is designed to interact with multiple instances of the HPI service, further sharding the client load between the available HPIs. The HPI service provides business logic to USTLO for managing network connections and communication with other services, including session management and connection metadata. The communication between USTLO and the HPI service is based on a custom bi-directional message format and includes mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and access control.\n\n--- and some more info \n\nThe HPI service includes several business logic conditions that can be triggered based on various factors, such as the type of connection, the headers in the request, and the ongoing status of the connection. Some examples of these conditions include:\n\nAdaptive bit rate management: The HPI service analyzes the first packet of a connection, typically the client hello message, to determine the type of connection and classify it to a web service, such as YouTube or Netflix. Based on the user profile, the HPI service notifies USTLO of the network parameters to use for the connection. USTLO then adapts the network conditions for that connection to optimize the user experience.\n\nHeader enrichment: For HTTP connections, USTLO notifies the HPI service with the headers from the request. Based on rules and the client profile, the HPI service can modify the headers and request USTLO to block the connection, forward it to another IP, or send the client a redirect response. This feature enables the HPI service to customize the network behavior based on the client's preferences and requirements.\n\nJust-in-time feature: USTLO periodically sends updates to the HPI service about an ongoing connection. Based on this data, the HPI service calculates specific network parameters to ensure that the client has a specific amount of data in its buffers. This feature is particularly useful for streaming applications, as it reduces data consumption while avoiding stalling and buffering, improving the user experience.\nplease integrate all this info in one coherent and well formatted spec, use markup to mark headers, bullets and lists \nsort out redundencies in the text, and assure well structured clear and understandable language",

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n50 In its notice of contention Beckhaus alleged that Master Macready had erred in failing to find that the Contract \u201chad been abandoned in futuro or terminated by the implied agreement or mutual acquiescence of the parties, and that therefore [the Council\u2019s] claim for liquidated damages could not succeed, even if [the Council] were given leave to amend\u201d.\n51 The notice of contention also asserted that the Council\u2019s application for leave to amend so as to claim liquidated damages should, in any event, have been refused \u201cby reason of the numerous areas of factual inquiry requiring further evidence which would have been raised by the proposed amended cross-claim\u201d.\n52 The notice of appeal and the notice of contention raised many other grounds that are encompassed in the grounds I have summarised above or which were not agitated on appeal or which have become irrelevant. I would add that there was a notice of cross-appeal filed by Beckhaus which, in effect, has been subsumed by the issues raised in the notice of appeal and the notice of contention.\nClaiming damages for defective performance while the Contract was on foot\n53 The notice of contention raises the question whether the Contract was terminated by mutual agreement. The Council long denied this proposition but, on the third day of the appeal, assented to it. Despite the Council\u2019s late acceptance of the proposition, the question remains relevant as it exposes a misconception by both parties in the way the issues were addressed at trial. The misconception was that the Council could claim damages from Beckhaus for defective and incomplete work while the work was still in Beckhaus\u2019 possession and while Beckhaus was still obliged (and entitled) to execute the work to practical completion. This misconception permeated the conduct of the case by all involved and complicated the identification of the true issues in the case.\n54 The reason for the Council\u2019s stand is not hard to find. It lies in cl 35.6 of the General Conditions which provided:\n\n\u2018If [Beckhaus] fails to reach Practical Completion by the date for Practical Completion, [Beckhaus] shall be indebted to [the Council] for liquidated damages at the rate stated in the Annexure for every day after the Date for Practical Completion to and including the Date of Practical Completion or the date that the Contract is terminated under Clause 44, whichever first occurs.\u201d\n\nThe Council wished to assert that the Contract remained on foot so as to enable it to make a large claim for liquidated damages. Thus, the Council believed that it was in its interests to contend that the Contract had not been terminated but, at the same time, to claim damages for defective and incomplete work.\n55 It is helpful to identify Beckhaus\u2019 obligations to perform the work under the Contract, Beckhaus\u2019 rights to be paid for its work, and the Council\u2019s rights in respect of breaches of the Contract by Beckhaus. Once those obligations and rights are identified, consideration must be given as to whether there was an agreed termination and, if so, how they were affected by the agreed termination.\n56 By cl 3.1 of the General Conditions, Beckhaus undertook to execute and complete the work under the Contract and the Council undertook to pay Beckhaus:\n\n\u201c(a) for work for which the [Council] accepted a lump sum, the lump sum;\n(b) for work for which the [Council] accepted rates, the sum ascertained by multiplying the measured quantity of each section or item of work actually carried out under the contract by the rate accepted by the [council] for the section or item,\nadjusted by any additions or deductions made pursuant to the contract.\u201d\n\nThus, by cl 3.1, the Council\u2019s obligation was to pay Beckhaus for the work executed and completed.",

Can you write a coherent text which utilises this information to explore the symbolism of Black Space and its role in the story of Omori, and keeping in mind that there are may other parts of black space not explored here? \n\n\u2022 The Absurd area: Corresponds to the absurd aspect of depression. The concept of the absurd can be commonly connected with depression and pain, as it embodies the meaninglessness of life which imprints itself on you when in this state. It is associated with questions like: \u201cWhat is the point of life when something like this can happen to me?\u201d, \u201cWhy did this have to happen?\u201d etc., giving rise to the concept of the absurd as a representation and aspect of Sunny\u2019s life and of what happened: something so accidental leading to such a catastrophic consequence. \u201cYou are far away from home.\u201d: far away from the meaning you thought you had. This whole area is about looking for answers and finding nothing but a sea of the Absurd.\no Mari-like figure can be found in a bed with strands of hair visible.\no Loquacious Cat: can be asked a bunch of traditionally meaningful questions but answers meaninglessly with random responses related to sewing. Reflects the Absurd as a phenomenon encountered by the depressed or mentally suffering; all these questions we have and expect answers to, or desperately desire answers to, are given no answer but the meaninglessness and emptiness of reality as we twitch and struggle asking \u201cWhy? Why did this happen?\u201d. The last question reads \u201cIs cereal a soup?\u201d. This question corresponds to having given up on asking the meaningful questions; on having given up on the meaning of reality and surrendered to the Absurd, asking a question just as ridiculous as the answers life gives you. It corresponds to Sunny having given up.\no Follow the cloud: random cloud guides you in a loop and exclaims; \u201cFollow the cloud!\u201d. Perhaps it corresponds to chasing of potential meanings which lead to nothing as you search for answers.\no Question marks: in the form of shadow figures, and can be found all over the place; a superficial reflection of the meaning of this area and the theme of questions.\n\u2022 Scribble area: Seems superficially meaningless. A kind of void with occasional \u2018scribbles\u2019 which reference Sunny\u2019s desire for the familiar.\n\u2022 Town area: Town resembling the neighbourhood where Sunny lives. A kind of dark and dreary reflection of the reality. Corresponds to one\u2019s image of the familiar being twisted and reshaped into the unfamiliar in the light of what happened. You can ring the bells on the doors, but nobody will answer; there is no one to go to. \no Body can be seen hanging from a tree (Mari)\no Trees can be turned upside down when interacting: a hint of the absurd similar to what defines the absurd area. It also hints at a certain wrongness; of things being \u2018upside down\u2019, which is a bit different from the concept of the absurd as seen before.\no Easter egg with graves (unrelated to story?)\no Deer-like shadows can be seen running but never progressing, similar to Sunny.\no Shadow Basil: \u201cOn that day, when you became nothing, I was split in half. Which one do you think was more painful?\u201d Unsure of what exactly this means. Does it refer to how one part of Basil which committed the act was repressed and \u2018sealed away\u2019 while the Basil remembered fondly was maintained, or something else? UPDATE: Maybe it simply refers to Headspace Basil and how he is split into Shadow Basil who knows the truth and is repressed, and the unknowing Basil who appears at the start of the game\n\u2022 Liar room: Dead, forested area where the words \u2018liar\u2019 are repeated in dialogue boxes. This room seems to be about the contradiction between Sunny\u2019s self-loathing; hiding the truth from everyone in his life (\u201cLiar\u201d) and the reality of what Mari actually would have wanted for him. When encountering Something (Mari), it says \u201cSunny\u2026 I love you.\u201d This room is about the tragedy of how Sunny can\u2019t forgive himself, yet the one thing that Mari would have wanted, is for him to do just that. Those faint words of encouragement which can barely reach him in the sea of vitriol he imposes upon himself, of : \u201cLiar liar liar\u201d\u2026 It\u2019s about the tragedy of how we can\u2019t forgive ourselves despite the love and forgiveness everyone else is willing to give us.",

        "prompt": "Here is some information about dilapidation reports that I want you to know. Please only consider it for now, I will send you further information shortly.\n\nWhat is a Dilapidation Report and What\u2019s Included?\n\nCondition report\nIf major construction will take place near your home, the integrity of your dwelling might just be at stake. Major construction often requires the use of heavy machinery that can cause damage to the surrounding area. To prevent future conflict, it is important to obtain a dilapidation report before any heavy construction or demolition job commences on nearby properties. This way you can defend yourself, protect your property, and prevent messy confrontations.\nTo understand what a dilapidation report is, what\u2019s included, and when you should get one, here is a comprehensive guide for you.\n\nWhat is a Dilapidation Report?\nA dilapidation report is a comprehensive inspection and documented report of the current condition of the neighbouring properties of a dwelling. It\u2019s a way for home owners to take proper precaution and obtain a record of a dwelling\u2019s current condition. This is usually requested before and after a major construction or demolition project. Also known as a condition report, a dilapidation inspection is a requirement for getting a Development Approval (DA) for a project that may cause possible damages to an adjacent property or adjoining properties.\n\nThe condition report is carried out not just to ensure the protection of nearby assets but also for that of the developer. By comparing the before and after construction reports, both parties can readily identify any existing building defects as well as damage that might have transpired as a result of the development work. This way, potential conflicts can be prevented ahead of time.\n\nYou can get a copy of a sample dilapidation report here.\n\nWhat\u2019s Included in the Report?\nA detailed condition report by experienced building inspectors includes exterior to interior inspection. It pays close attention to specific areas that have high chances of being affected by the project. The property\u2019s actual conditions will be measured and described in detail with the inclusion of diagrams and images. Specifically, the inspector will look into the condition of the following details:\n\nTile cracks around plumbing fixtures\nInternal wall and external wall cracks\nLoose or missing frames\nExterior brickwork cracks\nConcrete or pavers cracks\nGround movement indications\nArchitrave alignments\nLoose or missing roof shingles\nSigned individual copies of the condition report will be provided for both the builder and the property owner as a future reference.\n\nBook a dilapidation report now.\n\nWhen Do You Need One?\nWhile anyone is free to apply for a dilapidation report, obtaining a report is only needed in a few cases. These include major development projects, structure demolitions, and land excavations nearby your property. Other works that need a dilapidation report include the following:\n\nPipe laying works\nRoad construction\nDevelopment projects that cause ground vibration\nWhether or not a condition report is required by law in your locality, you need to acquire one as a precaution from possible litigation. You also need it for evidence to support damage claims as a settlement.\n\nWho Conducts Them?\nA dilapidation report to prevent any conflict of interest is carried out by third-party licensed professional building inspectors, like the experienced team at Inspect My Home. They are the only ones who have the expertise to meticulously assess and document the existing condition of a property before the onset of a heavy construction project and after its completion. Since a dilapidation report is a legal document, the inspectors\u2019 findings cannot be disputed.\n\nIf you need a comprehensive report for any property, always make sure that your inspector is a license holder and has a reliable reputation. This way, the dilapidation report is guaranteed to be accurate.\n\nDilapidation Report With Inspect My Home\nAs one of Australia\u2019s largest and most trusted building and pest inspection companies, Inspect My Home is committed to providing every client with a professional and thorough property inspection. We provide you with an informative and easy to understand report emailed to you within 24-48 hours.\n\nIf you need Dilapidation/Condition report services, get in touch with one of our experts to arrange a time or discuss getting a report for your project.

In the field of clinical data, transformers have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis and decision-making[Searle].\n\nSignificant benefits Transformers language models have, comparing traditional models, include:\n\n- \\*\\*Increased amount of data\\*\\*: Transformers can process large volumes of clinical data and retain context, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models. Self-attention mechanism enables a better understanding of the relationships between data, allowing for accurate predictions even with a large amount of data[Vaswani].\n- \\*\\*Increased speed:\\*\\* Transformer language models have faster training time than RNNs if you can access sufficient computing because of the paralysation method. Decreases recurrence in favour of drawing global relationships between input and output.\n- \\*\\*Increased accuracy:\\*\\* Transformer language models have been shown to outperform traditional language models in terms of accuracy.\n- \\*\\*Increased flexibility:\\*\\* Transformers are more flexible, allowing for the use of different types of data (e.g., images and text) and tasks (e.g., classification and generation).\n- \\*\\*Increased interpretability\\*\\*: They are easier to interpret, making it easier to comprehend how the model works and what it has learned.\n- \\*\\*Increased efficiency\\*\\*: They are more efficient, requiring less training data and computational resources. It allows for substantially higher parallelisation and takes much less time to train.\n\nTransformers have achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) translation quality, outperforming other models.",

        "prompt": "summary: Check Your Worldview at the Door\nI\u2019ve been asked, \u201cWhat was the most surprising thing you ever learned while doing fieldwork?\u201d I scratch my head over that one because I don\u2019t go out into the field with a very strong point of view. Of course, I\u2019m informed by my own experiences, my suspicions, and what my clients have told me, but I approach the interviews with a sense of what I can only call a bland curiosity.\n\nAs the researcher, it\u2019s my responsibility to find out what\u2019s going on; I\u2019m not invested in a particular outcome. Even more (and this is where the blandness comes from), I\u2019m not fully invested in a specific set of answers. Sure, we\u2019ve got specific things we want to learn\u2014questions we have to answer in order to fulfill our brief. But my hunger to learn from my participant is broad, not specific. I\u2019m curious, but I don\u2019t know yet what I\u2019m curious about. My own expectations are muted, blunted, and distributed. Although I will absolutely find the information I\u2019m tasked with uncovering, I also bring a general curiosity. Now, the people I work with don\u2019t have the luxury of bland curiosity. Whether they are marketers, product managers, engineers, or designers (or even other researchers), they often have their own beliefs about what is going on with people. This makes sense: if there\u2019s enough organizational momentum to convene a research project, someone has been thinking hard about the issues and the opportunities, and has come to a point of view.\n\nThe Brain Dump\nAt the beginning of the project, convene a brain dump (see Figure 2.1). Get what\u2019s in everyone\u2019s heads out on the table. Whether it\u2019s real-time, face-to-face, in front of a whiteboard, or asynchronously across offices on a wiki, talk through assumptions, expectations, closely-held beliefs, perspectives, and hypotheses. Contradictions are inevitable and should even be encouraged. The point is not establishing consensus; it\u2019s to surface what\u2019s implicit. By saying it aloud and writing it down, the issues leave the group specifically and enter an external, neutral space.\n\nImage\nFIGURE 2.1\nCapture everything that everyone thinks they know so that it\u2019s not stuck in their heads.\n\nIt\u2019s also not about being right or wrong; I encourage you to anonymize all the input so that people don\u2019t feel sheepish about expressing themselves. I wouldn\u2019t even go back and validate the brain dump against the resulting data. The objective is to shake up what is in your mind and free you to see new things. Think about it as a transitional ritual of unburdening, like men emptying their pockets of keys, change, and wallet as soon as they return home (Figure 2.2).",

        "prompt": "Please summarize below\n--------\n5 Benefits and Findings\n5.1 Enhancement of efficiency in requirement phase\n\nThe efficiency improvement of activities in the requirements phase was assessed through the application of EURECA. The data collected during the BC Card IT asset management system development project were analyzed and compared with those of the Korea Customs Service IT asset management system development project, which E4Net Inc. conducted before the BC Card project was conducted in the same domain. Details of the two projects are compared in Table 1, which shows that the project development period was the same for both projects (8\u2009months) and that the project sizes were similar in terms of volume. Table 1 indicates that the time spent in the requirements phase was 60\u2009man-days in the Korea Customs Service IT asset management system development project, which was the previously conducted development project, whereas only 8\u2009man-days were required for the development of the BC Card IT asset management system development project, for which related assets that were previously accumulated in storage were extracted by applying EURECA, and each requirement was revised by fetching the stored requirement. This finding confirms that time savings of approximately 87% was achieved. In addition to the requirements phase, which the EURECA application directly influences, in terms of the total development period, the BC Card system was less time consuming because the previous project was delayed by 1.5\u2009months. This was because of requests for changes after the requirements deadline was frozen, whereas BC Card has not experienced any time delays to date. These results suggest the increased correctness of the judgment of the domain experts in the requirements phase, the initial stage of the project, as EURECA supports environments in which new requirements are created, while the domain experts check that the requirement-related GUI forms are being animated according to the business flow.\nTable 1. Comparison of the elapsed times in the requirements phase\nPrecedent project case EURECA tool application project case\nProject name Korea Customs Service IT Asset Management System BC Card IT Asset Management System\nProject description Construct a system to manage IT asset-related finance, contract, and operational status during the life time Construct IT asset life cycle management system and asset acquisition support management system\nProject size\n\nProject budget: $220,000\n\nNumber of functional goals: 14\n\nNumber of screens: 130\nProject budget: $290,000\n\nNumber of functional goals: 17\n\nNumber of screens: 142\nProject period 8\u2009months 8\u2009months\nRequirements phase period 3\u2009months (60\u2009working days)\n\nApproximately 0.4\u2009month\n\n(Approximately 8\u2009working days)\nDevelopment delay because of the changed requirements 1.5\u2009months None (on-going)\n\n EURECA, end-user requirements engineering with collaborative animation.\n\nHowever, there is another factor that should be considered as a consequence of applying EURECA and that can be analyzed using the results in Table 1. As shown previously, the time that was saved is a return benefit resulting from reusing the requirements assets that were already constructed for the domain. Therefore, the work required to enter and arrange the requirements artifacts by domain in EURECA, according to the structure provided in Section 3, needs to be accounted for as overhead on the time savings shown in Table 1. The IT asset management system was processed by E4Net through EURECA before the construction of the BC Card system. The requirements stored in the repository were 37 functional goals, 142 GUI forms, and the related data items. The total elapsed time for storage construction was 1693\u2009minutes, which is equivalent to approximately 3.5\u2009working days. When this time is divided by the number of requirements (37) to obtain the storage construction time per requirement, it is found that the average time to construct domain storage per requirement was approximately 45.8\u2009minutes. On the basis of this, the time needed to store 17 functional goals can be estimated as 1.62\u2009man-days (778.6\u2009minutes). Considering the time spent on domain storage construction, the time saved through the use of EURECA can be estimated as 50.38\u2009man-days (=52\u2009man-days\u20131.62\u2009man-days) by comparing the time spent in the requirements phase for these two similar projects. This confirms that EURECA has contributed 83% to the efficiency of requirements elicitation in the BC Card IT Asset Management System Development case.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30",

Keith\n \u00b7 It is my view that we\u2019re offering as much strategic clarity as we currently have available to us yet I do appreciate the many want to know more. This is all about Digital Services to me. I further appreciate our move to DS is a shift in our thinking from delivering a physical asset to a virtual asset (which has physical attributes) to our customers with little knowledge of market size or use cases. An expansion of our thinking to engage the team is a broader understanding of what we\u2019re actually delivering as a Digital Service would likely be helpful. \u201cShow me the money\u201d comes to mind \u2013 show me what it is that we\u2019re doing and how does it represent itself \u2013 this may be helpful for many. Also, what is it that we\u2019re offering and why does the customer want it. What does the service look like? Do we have the team in place to make it happen? Who are we competing against?

We\u2019re in the early stages \u2013 this is a journey that is only getting started \u2013 let\u2019s not shy away for the ambiguity.\n \u00b7 I think we need to be more detailed, as noted above, so that the GLO team can fully appreciate the opportunity available to us. Again, I think one of the biggest issues we have is many have no idea what it is that we\u2019re actually doing or going to do. All they know is we\u2019re offering services that are \u201cdigital\u201d \u2013 they simply need to have a better understanding of what it is that we\u2019re trying to do and for whom.

Rati had been suffering from an acute case of the shivers from the moment Indra had turned up in their home with dire tidings. Owing to her closeness with Kama, and the uncanny intuition that is so peculiar to the female of the species she had always been troubled by the presence of death that seemed to hover over him. Mostly Rati would tell herself that she was acting exactly like a mortal female whose hormones had gone berserk and laugh off the incessant fear but on bad days, she would fret about it endlessly, wondering if there was not something she could do to keep her husband safe and by her side always. These clammy apprehensions that were the only cloud in an otherwise perfect existence, Rati discussed with no onenot even Kama. She voiced aloud her darkest suspicions only once, and to her surprise, it was to Goddess Saraswati with whom she shared an uneasy relationship at best. Brahmas consort had wanted to see the wonders of their palace of crystal and white marble that had become the highest authority on love, desire and pleasure. Kama had been most welcoming and given her a personal tour. Initially, on seeing the legendary beauty of her husbands stepmother, Rati had felt the slightest twinge of hostilitywhich was why she tried to make up for it by being thoroughly charming and warm to her. Conducting a quick comparison in the many, many mirrors that she had had erected all over their house so that she may better feast on the beauty of Kama and herself, she quickly gauged that despite her ethereal beauty, the freshness of youth was lacking in her husbands stepmotherand Rati was ridiculously pleased. At that moment when self-doubt had been sufficiently dispelled, she decided that Saraswati was not bad at all and it made perfect sense that Kama got along so well with her. Sensing the thaw in the other womans animosity, Saraswati had become pleasantly chatty. She told Rati about how Vasanta had come into Kamas life and her own role in the story. Playfully, Rati had declared that she now knew who to blame for her biggest competitor over Kamas affections, adding that the God of Spring followed him everywhere, like death. The two women had stopped laughing then, for Ratis careless utterance carried with it the weight of her terror and left her too choked up to go on. Saraswati had taken the woman destined for widowhood in her arms then and told her about the maras. The Goddess told her Brahmas words about the purpose they were intended to serve in Kamas life and assured her that they would never harm him. She told her about the first time she had seen them scattered around the God of Desire and the chill that had penetrated her being at that moment. Saraswati told Rati that the maras could have that effect and she should simply ignore them. The conversation had eased some of the anxiety that Rati borethough not entirely. She sensed that though Saraswati had not intended to deceive, portions of the truth were nevertheless being kept from her. Even so she fretted less, and the unease she felt on account of Kama fadeduntil the time of Indras visit when her trepidation returned in full measure. Rati had insisted on accompanying Kama for she could not bear to lose sight of his dear face. When death brushed close to him, en route to Shivas lonely abode, she felt the chill that had settled in his heart and grew cold herself. She cursed Indra for dragging Kama into his affairs, Kama for not refusing Indra point blank and herself for not dissuading him from his foolhardiness. Soorapadman, his vengeful mother and brothers, sage Kashyap, Brahma and even Shiva did not escape her baleful thoughts. It may have been a little selfish of her, but she saw no reason why Kama should be risking life and limb just because the Devas and Brahma between themselves had fouled up on such a gargantuan scale. Shiva was also to blame for their predicament, she decided. For if it were not for his ceaseless and self-indulgent grieving, he would have married Parvati and sired a dozen sons who would have easily taken care of Mayas brats. Worried that her despondency might affect Kama, Rati tried to control her wayward thoughts. She brightened when they reached their destination and saw Parvati. Rati could always tell when her husband found another woman beautiful and this was one of those times. His confidence was momentarily boosted and Rati felt good about their chances, for she was sure that Shiva would not be able to stay immune to such a flawless beauty blessed with a spiritual resplendence comparable to his own. Lulled into a false sense of hope, Rati waited with a confidence that would not waver even when she sensed Kamas despair. Taking his sensitive hands into her own, she willed him to succeed for all their sakes. She had been feeling sanguine about her efforts when Kama beat back his despair and ordered them to stand back, determination writ large on his exquisite features. Rati had begun to smell victory for her own Lord when Shiva opened his eyes and looked at Parvati with desire, an emotion she was far too familiar with to mistake. Rati had been about to run to Kama and wrap him in a congratulatory hugwhen he simply vanished from her sight. For long moments Rati did not comprehend what had happened as she stood there staring into the space that had once been her husband. In a dazed stupor, her mind began to reel furiously, painfullyas she realized that that husband was no moreand she collapsed in a heap, praying that the black abyss into which she had fallen would swallow her up and never spit her out into a world without Kama. Struggling unsuccessfully against the current that simply refused to let her be swept away, Rati found her consciousness returning. Vasanta had been holding her head in his lap and she recoiled from him in fury for having dared to touch the body that belonged solely to Kama. Turning to the pile of ashes that was all that was left of her husband, Rati began sifting through it purposefully, determined to recover at least a small fragment of that which she had lost. The tears that spilled out of her eyes blinded her completely, but still she persisted in her hopeless pursuit, wiping the phlegm running down her nose with ash-streaked arms and stifling the sobs that ceaselessly escaped from her throat. Watching her futile search, Vasanta wept for her and the friend he had lost. On and on she searched through the ashes, still fighting the sobbing fits as though determined to keep them at bay. Vasanta wished she would leave the ashes alone and simply cry, for if she stubbornly refused to allow the tidal wave of misery inside her an outlet, it would implode within her and she would die too. It is stupid of me to cry, she told the little mounds of ash surrounding her, finally desisting from her search as the persistent tears kept getting the better of her, I know that if there is one thing you simply cannot bear, it is the sound of crying. The sight of me dissolving in a salty flood of tears and blubbering like a baby is likely to be distasteful to you. Initially, I thought you found it to be a turn off since crying makes even the loveliest ladies look hideous, but I should have known better. You simply could not stand for me to be unhappy and liked nothing better than the sight of my smile. Ever since I realized that, I promised myself that there will be no more tears in our marriage and devoted all the effort possible towards making it happen. It was not an easy thing to pull off, for jealous fits would get me into a snit and the temptation to cry was strong, but I desisted for your sake. I continue to do so, Kama, for wherever you are, it is my wish that you will have no cause to grieve on my account.\nQuestion: 7976 chars / 1423 wordsThread: 190718 chars / 31202 words",

The goal of this shiny app is that my users know the structure and contents of the dataframe before hand but they want to visualize such data in a myriad of ways. Rather than me writing a super complex shiny app with hundreds of different visualizations, what well do is that my users will input in natural language that you can understand the type of data and plot they would like to see. Your only output can be a yaml format file that includes two type of identifiers: (1)plot: and then a string with the code that does all necessary data table transformations and ggplot only code for visualizations. or (2)text: whenever my users ask for a statistical test or a regression summary, youll also have the option to provide code whose output is not a plot but a text summary. The identifier in the yaml will help me detect which type of output you are generating and rendering it in the proper format. Again, your task is (a)understanding the data structure and labels for the data we have available in our app; (b)receiving my users requests that are constrained to the data we agreed upon; (c) ouputing a yaml that identifies the type of code you have produced (text or plot) and then a string with the code Ill use directly and with no further transformations to generate such plot or tet summary for my users.

        "prompt": "The relationship between the Chinese government and businesses is complex, with the government playing a significant role in the country's economy. State-owned enterprises have a dominant presence in key industries, creating competition for private and foreign-owned businesses. The government also sets economic policies and regulations, such as the \"Made in China 2025\" initiative to upgrade the country's manufacturing industry, but this could also lead to over-competition and protectionism. The government has a strong influence on resource allocation, affecting the access of private and foreign-owned businesses to resources like land and funding.\nFor Capitaland Investment to be successful in China, it will need to navigate these challenges and build relationships with the government. This includes complying with government policies and regulations, as well as gaining access to resources and support through effective relationships with the government.\nThe challenges mentioned above can be viewed as threats to Capitaland Investment. However, there are also potential opportunities, such as the potential for growth in the country's manufacturing industry with the government's push for advanced technologies, and the possibility of favourable treatment from the government if strong relationships are built.\n\nmake this a script for speaking",

There is a state of the world $s$ that takes two values $s\\_1$ and $s\\_2$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. Independent of the state of the world, there are four possible decisions $d\\_{A 1}, d\\_{B 1}, d\\_{A 2}$, and $d\\_{B 2}$. As in the adaptation model we discussed in class, in any given state, there are only two decisions of interest, but here we modify the payoffs slightly, as follows.\nWe write $u\\_A(d, s)$ and $u\\_B(d, s)$ to denote the payoffs to $A$ and $B$ in state $s$ when decision $d$ is taken. We write $i, j$, or $k$ for the parties $(A$ or $B)$ and $m$ or $n$ for the states $\\left(s\\_1\\right.$ or $\\left.s\\_2\\right)$. The following formal statements capture the idea that, in a given state, each party has a preferred decision but also would get a positive payoff from the other party's preferred decision, whereas both parties will get zero if either of their preferred decisions in the other state is taken.\n- In state $m$, decisions $d\\_{A n}$ and $d\\_{B n}$ yield 0 for both players:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0 \\\\\n& u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_2\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $K>0$ for player $B$, and similarly, $B$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{B m}$ yields $K$ for player $A$ :\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 1}, s\\_1\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 1}, s\\_1\\right)=K \\\\\n& u\\_A\\left(d\\_{B 2}, s\\_2\\right)=u\\_B\\left(d\\_{A 2}, s\\_2\\right)=K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- In state $m, A$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{A m}$ yields some $U\\_{A m}^\\*>0$ for $A$. Similarly, in state $m, B$ 's preferred decision $d\\_{B m}$ yields some $U\\_{B m}^\\*>0$ for $B$\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu\\_A\\left(d\\_{A m}, s\\_m\\right) & =U\\_{A m}^\\* \\\\\nu\\_B\\left(d\\_{B m}, s\\_m\\right) & =U\\_{B m}^\\*\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSuppose that in state $s\\_1$ we have $U\\_{A 1}^\\*>U\\_{B 1}^\\*$, but in state $s\\_2$ we have that $U\\_{B 2}^\\*>U\\_{A 2}^\\*$. Note that the previous assumptions imply that $K<\\min \\left\\{U\\_{A 1}^\\*, U\\_{B 1}^\\*, U\\_{A 2}^\\*, U\\_{B 2}^\\*\\right\\}$. We will study the following interaction:\n1. One party is given control of the decision\n2. The state $s$ is observed by both players\n3. The party with control chooses the decision\n4.

We created a dataset of player\\'96referee dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other and our dependent variable, the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.\nPlayer photos were available from the source for 1586 out of 2053 players. Players' skin tone was coded by two independent raters blind to the research question who, based on their profile photo, categorized players on a 5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin with neither dark nor light skin as the center value. \nAdditionally, implicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a race implicit association test (IAT), with higher values corresponding to faster white | good, black | bad associations. Explicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a racial thermometer task, with higher values corresponding to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks. Both these measures were created by aggregating data from many online users in referee countries taking these tests on.\nIn all, the dataset has a total of 146028 dyads of players and referees. A detailed description of all variables in the dataset can be seen in the list below.\n\nVariables:\nplayerShort - short player ID\nplayer - player name\nclub - player club\nleagueCountry - country of player club (England, Germany, France, and Spain)\nbirthday - player birthday\nheight - player height (in cm)\nweight - player weight (in kg)\nposition - detailed player position \ngames - number of games in the player-referee dyad\nvictories - victories in the player-referee dyad\nties - ties in the player-referee dyad\ndefeats - losses in the player-referee dyad\ngoals - goals scored by a player in the player-referee dyad\nyellowCards - number of yellow cards player received from referee\nyellowReds - number of yellow-red cards player received from referee\nredCards - number of red cards player received from referee\nphotoID - ID of player photo (if available)\n\nrater1 - skin rating of photo by rater 1 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrater2 - skin rating of photo by rater 2 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrefNum - unique referee ID number (referee name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nrefCountry - unique referee country ID number (country name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nmeanIAT - mean implicit bias score (using the race IAT) for referee country, higher values correspond to faster white | good, black | bad associations \nnIAT - sample size for race IAT in that particular country\nseIAT - standard error for mean estimate of race IAT \nmeanExp - mean explicit bias score (using a racial thermometer task) for referee country, higher values correspond to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks\nnExp - sample size for explicit bias in that particular country\nseExp - standard error for mean estimate of explicit bias measure\n\n## Task\nWe want to conduct an analysis for the above dataset by answering the question of whether soccer players with dark skin tone are more likely than those with light skin tone to receive red cards from referees.\n\n[Code]\nimport pandas as pd\nimport lux\ndf = pd.read\\_csv('CrowdstormingDataJuly1st.csv')\nprint(len(df))\ndf.head()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# playerShort (146028, object, julien-feret)\n# player (146028, object, Maxime Gonalons)\n# club (146028, object, Paris Saint-Germain)\n# leagueCountry (146028, object, Spain)\n# birthday (146028, object, 13.11.1985)\n# height (145765, float64, 175.0)\n# weight (143785, float64, 69.0)\n# position (128302, object, Left Midfielder)\n# games (146028, int64, 1)\n# victories (146028, int64, 1)\n# ties (146028, int64, 0)\n# defeats (146028, int64, 0)\n# goals (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowReds (146028, int64, 0)\n# redCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# photoID (124621, object, 93024.jpg)\n# rater1 (124621, float64, 0.75)\n# rater2 (124621, float64, 0.0)\n# refNum (146028, int64, 2758)\n# refCountry (146028, int64, 45)\n# Alpha\\_3 (146027, object, ESP)\n# meanIAT (145865, float64, 0.326689683726724)\n# nIAT (145865, float64, 2882.0)\n# seIAT (145865, float64, 0.0001508847298536)\n# meanExp (145865, float64, 0.356445562281524)\n# nExp (145865, float64, 1897.0)\n# seExp (145865, float64, 3.68802247340708e-05)\n\n[Code]\n# lots of skew for red cards, yellow cards\n# the relationship for the other variables largely looks good\n\n# there are examples where one marks 0.5 and the other does not. \n# alternatives surrounding this:\n # remove data points in which any rater gives a 0.5 rating\n # remove data points in which both rater gives a 0.5 rating and we classify by either or\n # we do a mean on the raters and treat this as a continuous variable\n \n# additional questions:\n # could there be something in which when we filter out players who have a lot of games interactions with referees\n # could there be something in which most players who are black have played little games (# not really so we will ignore)\n \n# we did not consider the moderating effect of the referee's country which has an implicit bias",

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n35 In the result, the Master dismissed the Council\u2019s cross-claim, save that he held that \u201cthe Council is entitled to damages for two small matters\u201d.\nThe judgment of 7 December 2004\n36 The matter was then re-listed for further argument. At that stage, the Council orally sought leave to amend its pleadings to incorporate a claim for liquidated damages. In opposing this application, Beckhaus, submitted (as the Master observed):\n\n\u201cThe [Contract] was discharged by implied agreement through the parties\u2019 mutual abandonment of the [Contract] in or about early 2002.\u201d\n37 On 7 December 2004 Master Macready handed down a further judgment.\n38 He noted that the parties had agreed that the amount owing in respect of his findings on the cross-claim was $40,000.\n39 In dealing with the application by the Council to amend so as to claim liquidated damages, the Master rejected Beckhaus\u2019 argument that the Contract had been abandoned or terminated. In doing so, he appears to have assumed that Beckhaus\u2019 contentions were based on the proposition that, by mutual agreement, the Contract had been rescinded ab initio. (Mr Rudge SC who, together with Mr Robertson, appeared for Beckhaus, disavowed to this Court having submitted at trial that the Contract had been so rescinded). The Master held that neither party had evinced such an intention.\n40 It appears that the Council accepted before the Master that, by reason of extensions of time to which Beckhaus was probably entitled, the date for practical completion (in respect of both Separable Portions A and B of the Contract) should be taken to be 31 March 2002. That being so, under the Contract the claim for liquidated damages could run from no earlier date.\n41 Master Macready upheld Beckhaus\u2019 submission that the Council was precluded from claiming liquidated damages after 27 May 2002. His reasoning was as follows. He held that the Council had failed to pay progress claim No 7 unconditionally. On the basis of that finding, Beckhaus, in terms of s 27(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act, had lawfully suspended work on 27 May 2002. It followed, the Master held, that the superintendent, acting reasonably, would have extended time for practical completion until unconditional payment was made. Accordingly, work (and practical completion) remained lawfully suspended as at the judgment date. Under the Contract, there could be no claim for liquidated damages for the period during which the time for practical completion was so suspended (that is, during the period from 27 May 2002 to the date of judgment).\n42 The Master noted that there had been \u201cno identification of any determination\u201d of the Contract (the Council was then contending that the Contract had not been terminated). He said:\n\n\u201cThe parties have not identified any matter in the present evidence that would be an end date [for the period of liquidated damages] and the likelihood is that any entitlement to liquidated damages will only arise following upon some other facts which lead to a termination of the contract after the present time.\u201d\n43 For this reason, and the relatively small amount that, on the Master\u2019s reasons, the Council could claim (that is, based only on a \u201clikely\u201d period of about two months \u2013 from not earlier than 31 March 2002 to 27 May 2002) the Master declined to give leave to plead a claim for liquidated damages.\n44 The Master turned to Variation 21. The gist of this claim was that, in breach of the Contract, the superintendent had failed to provide Beckhaus with a list of defects upon Beckhaus asserting that practical completion had been reached. Beckhaus contended that this failure caused it to keep its major earthmoving equipment at Brewarrina and entitled it to delay costs, alternatively to damages.\n45 Master Macready appears, however, to have upheld this claim on a different basis, namely, because the Council had substantially failed in its cross-claim, there was no practical need for Beckhaus to have kept its equipment on site as the superintendent had required. The Master said:\n\n\u201cIt is apparent from discussions, which took place on 3 April 2002 between the Council and [Beckhaus], that the Council was raising a large number of matters which might require further work by [Beckhaus]. The matter escalated into the service of notices of dispute on about 24 April 2002 and accordingly it was probably reasonable for [Beckhaus] to keep its equipment on site until the time claimed namely 27 April 2002. In my view [Beckhaus] is entitled to this variation.\u201d",

        "prompt": "\u201cCourse 1 - Title: The emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nCourse 1 - Concepts:\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution.\n\nCourse 2 - Title: Female value and chastity. \n\nCourse 2 - Concepts:\u2028 \nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns.\nCourse 3 - Title: Life begins with the heart. \n\nCourse 3 - Concepts:\n\nLife begins with the heart. The heart is what nourishes life, it pours life force into the body and is the provision behind all manifestation. \n\nTrue wealth is love. The heart produces plasmic etheric substance that nourishes creation. The mind is the architecture of heart\u2019s essence. The higher heart is capable of lighting up the entire body and begin the process of g e ne code-ons regeneration. \n\nThe only way to connect to source is through our own heart. Only innocence is able to pass through dimensional gateways and connect straight to source. When someone is disconnected from their own heart/innocence, they are starving for the life giving substance which is the living light plasma of love. The person becomes parasitic through connecting to other\u2019s hearts and sourcing plasma from them. Unfortunately majority of humans have been heartbroken for generations. Broken heart can become inverted and darkened which causes the mind to become predatory/manipulative in finding an outlet to plug into in order to sustain life. This is known as artificial life. Predator mind is what gaslights, uses mind control mechanisms etc. Artificial life needs \u201clove\u201d but it can not perpetuate love in a free flow between two living hearts, it can only siphon plasmic light. It is not possible to love artificial life into loving itself, it will only consume what it can and move onto the next heart.\u201d\n\nDesign a comprehensive course outline for a 3-week online course on \u2018The primordial feminine and the Heart,\u2019 based on the above ideas in quotes by Zarina, a psychic, author, and activist. The course should explore her key concepts, theories, and principles, as outlined in the above sample. Additionally, include case studies and practical exercises to enrich the learning experience.",

        "prompt": "create 5 title headlines Earlier this week, the Tate Britain museum made an exciting announcement that when it unveils the rehanging of its galleries on May 23, it will give more importance to female artists from the 17th century until today. The museum is committed to showcasing more than 800 works by over 350 artists, including recent discoveries, new commissions, and favorites. Notably, half of the contemporary artists on display will be women, such as Bridget Riley, Tracey Emin, Kudzanai-Violet Hwami, and Lydia Ourahmane.\nIn their statement, the Tate Britain museum highlighted their long-standing commitment to diversifying their collection. The Tate is happy to exhibit excellent female artists from the 17th to 19th centuries, some of whom have never been displayed before. In recent years, the museum has acquired many artworks by female artists, some of which will be newly on display. For example, In 2016, the Tate purchased a full-length portrait made by Joan Carlile, who is considered the first British professional oil painter. The Tate also obtained 29 watercolor paintings by Emily Sargent, who is the sister of the famous artist John Singer Sargent. These paintings were found in a trunk by a family member back in 1998 and the museum acquired them in 2021.\nPolly Staple, the director of collection, British art, expressed her enthusiasm for the new displays, stating that they embody the museum's commitment to expanding the canon and diversifying British art history. She believes that visitors will be delighted to see the new acquisitions hung alongside more familiar and much-loved classics.\nThe Tate Britain's decision to focus on women artists marks a significant shift in the museum's project. The upcoming rehang of the museum's collection will have 800 artworks from over 350 artists, with half of them being female artists. This is the first rehang in 10 years and marks a fresh start for the museum.\nAlex Farquharson, the head of the Tate Britain, believes that the upcoming rehang will give visitors a chance to explore British art's story more profoundly and reflect on how it impacts, confronts, and motivates us. The Tate Britain is committed to showcasing a wealth of Britain's art diversity, including art from 500 years ago.\nThe museum will highlight both historically significant artworks and artists, such as John Constable and Henry Moore, as well as new and contemporary artists. For example, Rachel Jones's colorful acrylics and Rene Mati\u0107's photography will have their place in the Tate Britain. Andrea Schlieker, who leads the exhibition and display team at the Tate Britain, thinks that this show has the potential to make us contemplate our past and imagine a more definite path forward.\nJoan Carlile, the first female professional painter, will also have her work displayed at the museum, as well as many other female artists from different eras and centuries. The Tate Britain's focus on women artists aims to provide a platform for those who have never had the opportunity to display their works before.\nThe Tate Britain is not just limited to rehanging its collection, as it is set to launch a new project in May to examine how the country's history of colonization and the slave trade is connected to national collection artworks. This undertaking is part of the museum's commitment to correctly representing contemporary society norms through its collection.",

        "prompt": "Here's another personal statement that's considered excellent for college admissions. Can you highlight multiple reasons why it worked well (in bullet point format)?\n\nPersonal Statement:\nENTOPTIC PHENOMENA\nI subscribe to what the New York Times dubs \u201cthe most welcomed piece of daily e-mail in cyberspace.\u201d Cat pictures? Kardashian updates? Nope: A Word A Day.\n\nOut of the collection of diverse words I received, one word stuck out to me in particular. \n\nEntoptic: relating to images that originate within the eye (as opposed to from light entering the eye). Examples of entoptic phenomena: floaters, thread-like fragments that appear to float in front of the eye but are caused by matter within the eye. (for a picture: https://wordsmith.org/words/entoptic.html)\n\nAs I read through this entry, I was suddenly transported back to the first grade, when I was playing Pok\u00e9mon Go one day with my friends during recess. Our version was epic: we escaped into virtual reality with our imagination rather than our phone screens, morphing into different Pok\u00e9mon to do battle.\n\nMy friend Ryan had just transformed into an invisible ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon capable of evading my attacks. Flustered, I was attempting to evolve my abilities to learn to see the invisible. Between rubbing my eyes and squinting, I began to make out subtle specks in the air that drifted from place to place. Aha\u2014the traces of the ghost Pok\u00e9mon! I launched a thunderbolt straight through the air and declared a super-effective knockout.\n\n...Of course, I never was able to explain what I was seeing to my bewildered friends that day in first grade. But after learning about entoptic phenomena, I realized that my entoptic adventure was not a hallucination but, in fact, one of my first intellectual milestones, when I was first able to connect meticulous observation of my environment to my imagination.\n\nNowadays, I don\u2019t just see minuscule entoptic phenomena: I see ghosts, too. Two of their names are Larry and Kailan, and they are the top-ranked players in the Exynos League.\n\nExynos is the name of the elaborate basketball league I have created in my imagination over the last ten years of playing basketball on the neighborhood court in the evenings. As I play, I envision Larry and Kailan right there with me: reaching, stealing, and blocking. Undoubtedly, I might look a little silly when I throw the ball backwards as if Larry blocked my layup attempt\u2014but imagining competitors defending me drives me to be precise in my execution of different moves and maneuvers. More than that, it is a constant motivator for all my endeavors: whether I\u2019m researching for debate or studying for the next math contest, I am inventing and personifying new competitive ghosts that are hard at work every minute I\u2019m off task.\n\nBut I perceive perhaps the most vivid images through music, as I tell a different story with each piece I play on the violin. When I play Bach\u2019s lively Prelude in E Major, for example, I visualize a mouse dashing up and down hills and through mazes to escape from an evil cat (\u00e0 la Tom and Jerry). But when I play Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto, I describe a relationship plagued by unrequited love. I revel in the intellectual challenge of coming up with a story that is not only consistent with the composer\u2019s annotations but also resonates with my own experiences.\n\nBetween re-living Tom and Jerry episodes and shooting fadeaway three-pointers against ghosts, then, perhaps entoptic phenomena don\u2019t tell my whole story. So, here\u2019s my attempt\u2014in the form of a word of the day, of course:\n\nPok\u00e9mon Boom: a legendary form of augmented reality so pure that it is commonly mistaken for hallucination.

        "prompt": "Here is an example of my writing from a paper I wrote, please analyze my style and remember it!\n\n\"New neural stimulation methods are needed to advance neural interfaces to aid in treating neurological diseases. Current stimulation methods, such as Deep Brain Stimulation or Vagus Nerve Stimulation, are highly invasive and require subsequent surgery to replace the batteries. Additionally, the stimulation of neurons through optical or electrical methods is complex due to the signal\u2019s attenuation as it passes through tissue and bone. Magnetic fields could potentially stimulate neurons without signal attenuation and the capability to penetrate the body deeply. The depth of magnetic stimulation is based on the distance from the source of stimulation. Unlike ultrasound or electromagnetic radiation, magnetic field lines are unhindered by tissue due to the low amount of magnetic forces in blood[1]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows that it could be an effective stimulating agent. The size of the electromagnetic coils needed for transcranial magnetic stimulation limits its potential as a neural interface. Ideally, the neural interface would be able to be used in the daily life of patients with minimal interference. Therefore, large electromagnetic coils are impractical as neural interfaces due to their size and immobility. \nMagnetoelectric nanoparticles(MENs) could alleviate the issue by allowing lower-intensity magnetic fields to stimulate neurons electrically. Due to their nanoscale size, MENs could be anchored directly to the targeted neurons\u2019 ion channels. Therefore, as the magnetic field(primary signal) reaches the MENs, they will transduce the magnetic field into local electricity(secondary signal), which would be focused onto the ion channel, potentially causing it to activate. Using this principle, a lower magnetic field aided by MENs could have a similar effect on neurons as a higher electric field. 30 nm CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 magnetoelectric core-shell nanoparticles have been used to prove this by affecting EEG waveforms with a weak magnetic field of 10mT at 20 Hz[2]. The previously stated MENs utilize the nonzero magnetoelectric effect[3] caused by the coupling of electric and magnetic fields in the MENs. In the study, under a 10mT magnetic field, the MENs could produce an electric field of 100V/M. The resulting electric field would be released within nanometers of the ion channels. It can be seen that the magnetic field needed to stimulate neurons with MENs could be drastically reduced as the transduced signal is highly focused on targeting the ion channels. In this study, C. elegans will be used as a model organism to test the effect of MENs on neuron behavior. Voltage-gated calcium channels will be targeted for MENs binding because if the channels are activated, the excitability of the neurons will increase. \nMethods\n The preparation of CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 will be synthesized according to the published procedures, which consist of a two-step wet chemical procedure as depicted in figure 1[4.]. \nFigure 1: A depiction of the fabrication of CoFe 2O4-BaTiO3. CoFe2O4 (sample CFO) was synthesized by chemical co-precipitation, ferrofluid was prepared, then core-shell nanostructures of CoFe2O4\u2013BaTiO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel technique [4.]\n \nA cobalt ferrite core should be surrounded by a barium titanate shell-like coating [4.]. The MENs will need to be coated to ensure the neural interface\u2019s stability in a biological system. \nFor the MENs to attach to C. Elegans neuronal plasma membranes, the MENs and plasma membrane will need to be modified to allow for binding. To ensure the MENs can bind to the plasma membrane, the MENs will be surface coated with streptavidin using succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce) as cross-linker as shown in [5]. With streptavadin attached to the surface of the MENs, it will allow the connection of MENs to streptavidin to biotin, as shown in figure 2. \nFigure 2: The above figure depicts the linking of MENs to the neuron's plasma membrane. The AP-CFP-TM protein complex is used as an anchor protein with the biotinylated AP region binding to the streptavidin, which is surface coated onto the MEN[5]. \nIn order to stimulate and observe the animals in this experiment, the genetic modification of C. elegans will be required. C. elegans expressing GCAMP6 will be acquired, such as CX17256kyIs722 [str-2p::GCaMP5(D380Y) + elt-2::mCherry], a strain of C. elegans which expresses GCaMP5a[6]. GCAMP is a genetically encoded calcium indicator that will allow for the imaging of neuronal activity via fluorescent imaging[7]. Once obtained, the C. elegans would need to be modified to have their plasma membranes bound to the MENs. In order to achieve this, microinjection will be utilized to have the AP-CFP-TM plasmid transfected into the C.elegans. Microinjection is a method for creating transgenic animals that requires injecting DNA into the distal arm of the gonad[8]. Due to the fact the distal arm of the gonad houses the central core of the germ cytoplasm, the injected DNA will spread efficiently to the offspring[8]. By inserting the AP-CFP-TM plasmid, the offspring will express the protein in their nuclear plasma membranes. The membrane marker protein AP-CFP-TM comprises a transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor, fluorescent protein, and a biotin acceptor protein. The biotin acceptor protein is enzymatically biotinylated, which forms binding sites for the conjugated MENs allowing for stimulation of the C. elegans[5].\n \nTo stimulate C. elegans, a method of creating an electromagnetic field without hindering the microscope is necessary. An electromagnet capable of at least 0.1T is needed to do this. Figure 3 depicts the electromagnet chosen for the design as it satisfies the project's needs.\n \nFigure 3: The 5203 electromagnet by GMWAssociates can vertically provide a projected magnetic field from its faceplate. It weighs 2.5kg and can achieve 0.5T up to 5mm away from the faceplate. \n To prepare the C. elegans for the experiments, the functionalized streptavidin-coated MENs will be microinjected into AP-CFP-TM expressing C. elegans. With the MENs injected into the head region of the C. elegans, the MENs should begin to bind to the AP-CFP-TM proteins anchored to the plasma membrane. Once this process is completed, the experiment may proceed. \nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the experimental setup. Two electromagnets would be positioned on the sides of a dual arena microfluidic device. The device would be capable of holding two groups of C. elegans.\nEach experiment will consist of twenty trials with two groups of C. elegans. Group one will consist of the MENs-modified C. elegans, and Group 2 will be the control. In each trial, both groups will be placed in a microfluidics device subjected to a 100Hz magnetic field starting from the minimum to the maximum magnetic field in increments of 1 mT. Each trial will last for 120 seconds. The first 30 seconds will observe baseline neural activity, and the next 90 seconds to observe stimulated neural activity. \nTo image the neuronal activity, fluorescent imaging will be used. A Zeiss AxioObserver.A1 with an inverted body with Zeiss Fluar objective lenses will be used[6]. The timing of the camera and the electromagnets would be handled through a program named micromanager. The results will be recorded and analyzed using neurotracker, and the intensity of the neural activity will be compared for the control and the modified C. elegans.\"",

This is more like a negotiation between both parties which all of them must agree once they come up with a resolution.\n\nFor this type of dispute resolution, the mediator must not decide for both parties nor take sides.

Nevertheless, with its growing popularity among builders and owners, lots of money, time, and effort were saved through mediation.\n\nWhat is Arbitration?\nArbitration is another alternative dispute resolution where a third party makes a binding decision. Its difference from litigation is that arbitration is done outside of the court. An arbitrator looks into the legal rights of each party and hears both parties to come up with a decision.\nSimilar to mediation, this process is inexpensive and doesn\u2019t take too much time for the whole process. However, there can also be instances where the process might take longer than expected, depending on the kind of dispute being settled.\n\nAdvantages of Arbitration\nConfidential\nInexpensive compared to litigation\nQuicker\nMore efficient than the usual court process\nMore flexible\nJust like in a court trial, there are certain procedures that can also be done in an arbitration such as hearings, pleadings, and cross examinations. Moreover, this can done voluntarily or if it is included in the agreement in the contract.\n\nWhat is the Difference between Mediation and Arbitration?\nArbitration is a more structured process than mediation. Because there are procedures in arbitration that are very much alike in a court trial, it\u2019s safe to say that arbitration has a bit formality in its process than mediation.\nBasically, mediation is just a facilitated negotiation between disputing parties requiring agreement form all parties while arbitration involves a third party imposing a decision for both that must be enforced.\n\nWho can assist with Mediation and Arbitration?\nMediation ad arbitration are both legal matters that must not be done without the guidance of an expert. Hence, a building and construction lawyer is the best option to ask for help to make sure that you are taking the proper steps in your situation.\n\nWhat is the Role of Building Lawyers in Mediation and Arbitration?\nWhen a dispute starts to escalate, you immediately need the help of a legal expert. Taking the right legal advice is a step forward to make sure you don\u2019t mess up. No one wants to another problem to be born out of the current problem.\n\nClient Representation\nMediation and arbitration could be an intimidating thing. That\u2019s why it helps that you get a helping hand with how you can better enforce your rights and protect your interests. In arbitrations, lawyers are allowed to represent their clients. This somehow eases the burden for both parties as their rights can be well-asserted by having their building lawyers represent them.\n\nHow can Contracts Specialist help with\nMediation and Arbitration?\nContracts Specialist is a Sydney-based law firm specialising in building and construction.

        "prompt": "rewrite this paragraph is a clear and professional language :\nSome of my initial plans were the Zillow API, and the Apartments.com data to source rental information about the houses in and around college park. However, by the time I started this project, the Zillow API had been deprecated, and Apartments.com and Zillow had both put up captchas to disable scraping as well.\n\nI found more housing data on the US 2021 census data website. The census data covers a lot of information, however, that's an aggregated source of data, and so there's no information about particular housing/apartment, but more of the entire region as a whole. Considering that, I chose 6 regions for the project : College Park, Hyattsville, Adelphi, Berwyn Heights, Riverdale Park, and University Park.\n\nIt took a little cleaning and filtering, and the next goal was to present this data in a viable format. I started off with kepler.gl, which meant I needed geojson for each of these areas. Maps usually do not provide geojson for \"areas\", so it took a bunch of scraping the census website (which showed the map in the background) to get that out. Once obtained, I tried to plot the geojson in kepler, but kepler refused to link the data to the geojson. After a couple of tries, I moved to deck.gl, uber's data viz solution. Unfortunately, I was unable to get Deck to work. The map refused to show, and so did the rest of it. After a week to trying that out, I switch to a more manual method. I exported the geojson to svgs, and built out this website with Figma and framer. \n\nUnfortunately, doing data analysis by hand, and extracting important conclusions is a taxing process, which is why only College Park is out and ready to go.\n\nA future possible goal would be to generate trustworthy-ness ratings to housing postings and apartments on the basis of the area and crime rates, and from that, be able to generate a dependable directory of housing accessible to students heading into UMD. At the current stage, it won't be exactly affordable, but at this point of time, housing availability is a more pressing concern.",

I will give you the next content after you acknowledge the third content. \nWhat's the difference between arbitration and mediation?\nArbitration and mediation are two very different processes that allow parties to resolve disputes outside of court. Mediation involves a facilitated negotiation, whereas arbitration involves a third party decision maker.\n\nWhat is mediation?\nMediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where the parties engage in negotiation to resolve the issues in dispute. An independent third party, the mediator, will assist the parties to identify the key issues in dispute and consider options and alternatives to settle the matter.\n\nMediation can be voluntary, court ordered or required as part of a dispute resolution clause in a contract.\n\nThe mediator acts as an independent third party who facilitates the discussion between the disputing parties. They will explain how the mediation will take place, identify the real issues in dispute by asking questions to the parties and help develop options to resolve the dispute.\n\nIn most mediations, the parties will be physically separated - as in, they will sit in different rooms, with the mediator speaking with one party at a time, shuffling between parties through the course of the mediation.\n\nAs an independent third party, the mediator can provide innovative solutions that the parties may not have considered prior to the mediation. However, they will not give advice, take sides or make decisions.\n\nIn commercial disputes, and depending on the size of the matter, mediators are often retired judges or other senior lawyers.\n\nA mediation usually occurs over the space of a single day. However the parties are able to adjourn a mediation and reconvene on another date if they agree that it may result in a resolution.\n\nWhat are the advantages of mediation?\nSome of the key advantages of mediation include:\n\nit is much less formal and more cost effective than arbitration or litigation;\nit is confidential;\nthe parties can offer creative settlements that go beyond usual monetary offers. This allows both parties to make offers that protect their commercial interests which can facilitate a win/win outcome;\ncompared with litigation or arbitration, it is extremely inexpensive;\nit happens over a relatively short space of time.\nEven where mediation does not resolve the matter, the process can clarify the issues in dispute which will help keep costs down if the matter goes to arbitration or litigation.\n\nMediation may not be suitable where the commercial relationship has broken down and there is a real sense that one of the parties is not willing to negotiate.\n\nThe obvious disadvantage with mediation is that it's not guaranteed to produce an outcome. It depends on both parties being willing to negotiate, and their ability to reach an agreement that will be acceptable to both of them.\n\nWhat is arbitration?\nArbitration is a process of dispute resolution where an independent adjudicator makes a binding decision on the issues in contention based on the evidence presented by the parties. \n\nIn a practical sense, arbitration is quite similar to litigation - except that arbitrations are conducted outside of court.\n\nArbitration usually arises as a result of a dispute resolution clause in a contract. It can also arise where the parties voluntarily decide to go to arbitration (for example, to keep the matter private).\n\nThe arbitrator is chosen by agreement between the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on a specific arbitrator, they will often agree on an independent person or body to appoint the arbitrator. \n\nUnlike mediation, arbitration has a more structured and formal process. For example, in arbitration:\n\nthere is a hearing, just like in a court case;\nthere can be a lengthy pre-trial process, involving pleadings, discovery and the preparation of written witness statements;\nparties may be cross examined during the trial;\nthe arbitrator will usually issue a detailed written decision after the hearing.\nAn arbitral decision can normally be registered in court, and then enforced like a court judgement. There are circumstances where an arbitrator's decision can be appealed, however this will sometimes depend on the nature of the error involved.\n\nAlthough the arbitration is very similar to litigation, arbitration offers a more flexible and efficient process. It can often be finalised in a much shorter time frame than litigation.\n\nArbitrators have a legal background and will usually have expertise in the area that is the subject of the dispute. The arbitrator will decide:\n\nhow the process will run (although often the parties will agree be bound by specific arbitration rules, such as the Resolution Institute Arbitration Rules; and\nthe outcome of the dispute.\nWhat are the advantages of arbitration?\nSome of the key advantages of arbitration include:\n\nunlike mediation, it is certain to result in a resolution of the dispute. This is because there will be a final binding award made by an independent third party; \nit is sometimes more efficient and cost effective than litigation;\nunlike litigation, arbitration remains confidential; and\nthe process is flexible and can sometimes be determined by the parties.\nWhile arbitration can sometimes be cheaper than litigation, often it will end up costing roughly the same. The parties will still have to pay legal fees (and usually the other party's fees if they are unsuccessful), the adjudicator\u2019s fees and other incidental costs (such as transcript fees and room hire costs).\n\nDepending on the nature of the dispute, it is rare for a commercial arbitration to be concluded in less than 6 months. At the same time, it is not uncommon for an arbitration to run for more than a year (just like litigation).\n\nArbitration can provide an effective means of resolving a dispute where mediation or negotiation has failed, and where the parties would prefer for the dispute to be kept outside the public domain.",

        "prompt": "Please summarize this news release in the style of JK Rowling:\n\nGovernment of Canada Announces Deductions and Next Steps to Curb Private Health Care Paid Out-of Pocket\nFrom: Health Canada\n\nNews release\nMarch 10, 2023 | Ottawa, ON | Health Canada\n\nUniversal, accessible, and publicly funded health care is a point of pride for Canadians and a priority for the Government of Canada. Under the Canada Health Act, it is made clear that no Canadian should be paying out of pocket for medically necessary services. Upholding the Canada Health Act (CHA) remains critical to protecting our health care system and ensuring Canadians have access to necessary care, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nToday, the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Health, announced mandatory Canada Health Transfer (CHT) deductions totalling over $82 million in respect of patient charges levied during 2020-21 for medically necessary services that should be accessible to patients at no cost. He also announced next steps to curb private medically necessary health care being paid out-of-pocket by Canadians, with a focus on virtual care and other medically necessary services that Canadians are being asked to pay for.\n\nThis includes the first deductions taken under the Diagnostic Services Policy (DSP), totalling over $76 million for patient charges levied for medically necessary diagnostic imaging services. An additional $6 million was also deducted for other patient charges, including those levied for insured services provided at private surgical clinics and for access to insured abortion services.\n\nThe goal of the CHA has never been to levy penalties, but rather to ensure patients are not charged for the insured services they have already paid for through their taxes. If a province or territory permits patient charges for medically necessary health services, a mandatory deduction must be taken from the jurisdiction\u2019s CHT payments.\n\nThe Minister of Health has also sent a message to his PT colleagues reiterating our collective responsibility in ensuring Canadians\u2019 ability to access medically necessary services without having to pay out of pocket, no matter where they live in the country or how care is delivered. The COVID-19 pandemic created a need for our health system to adapt and provide alternative ways for Canadians to continue accessing health care, in particular virtual care. While there are benefits to these new approaches, there has also been an increase in reports of patient charges to access medically necessary care, that would otherwise be covered if provided in-person by a physician. It is critical that access to medically necessary services, whether provided in-person or virtually, remains based on medical need and free of charge.\n\nAs our health care system and the nature of care evolves, the federal interpretation and administration of the CHA must evolve with it, so Canadians can have continued access to care without financial barriers. The Government of Canada will not tolerate and will take action to address patient charges, including those for surgical abortion services, diagnostics, as well as other insured services received in private clinics.\n\nCanadians and their families deserve timely access to health care services they need, and they expect their governments to work together to find immediate and longer-term solutions to these challenges. The federal government will continue working closely with PTs to help ensure all Canadians have equitable access to medically necessary care based on their needs, not their ability to pay.",

Mark mentioned how his dad collected vintage watches and how he had started to appreciate them too. Tommy talked about how his grandfather had served in World War II and showed him old photos of the war.\nTommy and Mark were sitting in their third-period English class when Mark leaned over and whispered, \"Hey, Tommy, you wanna hang out this weekend?\"\n\nTommy raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"Sure, where do you wanna go?\"\n\nTommy said excitedly, \"I found an old antique shop in town last weekend. I want to go back and check it out some more. Maybe we could ride our bikes there right after school on Friday?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we could ride our bikes into town and check out the shops. Maybe grab some ice cream,\" Mark suggested.\n\nTommy felt a pang of nervousness in his chest. He had never hung out with someone after school before, let alone rode his bike into town. But something about the idea excited him. \"That sounds cool,\" he said, trying to sound nonchalant.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAs they made their way to lunch, Tommy felt a flutter of anticipation in his stomach. He was looking forward to spending time with Mark, even if he was still a little nervous. They talked more about their plans for Friday, and Tommy couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie with Mark.\n\nBut as they were leaving the cafeteria, a group of boys intercepted them. Tommy recognized them as the same kids who had taunted him earlier. \"Hey, where do you think you're going on those bikes?\" one of them jeered.\n\nSuddenly, they heard a snicker coming from a nearby table. Tommy's heart sank. \n\n\"Hey look, it's the bike brigade!\" one of the bullies sneered.\n\nTommy and Mark ignored the taunts and continued to make plans for the weekend. But as they were leaving the cafeteria, they heard more jeers from the bullies.\n\n\"Have fun on your bike ride, lovebirds!\" another bully shouted, which drew more laughter from the group.\n\n---------------------------\n\nAfter class, they make their way to the bike racks and as they're about to take off, a group of kids approach them. It's the usual crowd of bullies.\n\n\"Hey, look at these two little babies, going on a bike ride!\" one of the bullies taunts.\n\nTommy and Mark try to ignore them and continue on their way, but the bullies won't let up.\n\n\"Where are you two losers going? To the park to have a picnic?\" another bully chimes in.\n\nTommy's face flushes with embarrassment and he can feel the weight of his backpack making him feel even more vulnerable. Mark tries to stand up for them, but it only makes things worse.\n\n\"Leave us alone,\" Mark says, his voice shaking slightly.\n\nThis only causes the bullies to laugh even harder. \"What are you going to do about it, crybaby?\"\n\nAs they finally make their escape, he can't help but wonder if it will always be like this.\n\nAfter school, they met at the bike racks and started pedaling towards town. They chatted about school and sports, and Mark even told a few jokes that made Tommy laugh. He was starting to feel like he was actually having a good time.\n----------------------------\n\nOnce they're a few blocks away, Tommy takes a deep breath and tries to shake off the humiliation. Mark is apologetic, but Tommy tells him it's not his fault.\n\n\"Let's just forget about it and have a good time, okay?\" Tommy suggests.\n\nAs the ride together, Tommy shared more about his struggles with the bullies.\n\n\"It's just so frustrating. I don't understand why they keep picking on me. I don't even know what I'm doing wrong,\" Tommy said with a sigh.\n\nMark sympathized, \"Yeah, I know how you feel. I get picked on too, mostly for being into comics and not sports. But you can't let them get to you. You just have to be yourself and ignore them.\"\n\nTommy nodded, \"I know, it's just easier said than done.\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAs they rode down the main street, Tommy spotted an old antique shop that he had never noticed before. \"Hey, let's check that place out!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the shop.\n\nMark nodded in agreement, and they parked their bikes outside the store. As they stepped inside, the musty smell of old furniture and books hit them. They wandered through the aisles, admiring the vintage items and curiosities on display.\n\nThey come across a small antique shop. It's nestled in between two larger, modern stores, and they decide to take a look inside. They lock up their bikes and head in. The shop is dimly lit and the air is musty. It's filled with all sorts of odd trinkets and antiques, and the two boys spend a while wandering around, pointing out the strangest items they see. Eventually they stumble upon an old pocket watch, its intricate design gleaming in the dim light. \n\nHe turned to Mark and showed him the watch. \"Isn't this cool?\" he asked.\n\nMark examined the watch and nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, it's really neat. Do you think it still works?\" he wondered.\n\nTommy shrugged. \"I don't know, but I bet we could figure it out,\" he said.\n\nHe approached the glass case and asked the shopkeeper to take a closer look.\n\nTommy notices that it had a strange symbol on the face. He's intrigued by its intricate design. \n\n\"Do you know what this symbol means?\" Tommy asks the shop keeper.\n\nThe shop owner tells him it's from the 1800s. \n\nAs he held the watch in his hand, Tommy felt a sense of wonder and nostalgia. It was like he was holding a piece of history in his palm. \n\nAs they left the shop, Tommy felt a newfound sense of connection with Mark. They may not have been the most popular kids in school, but they had each other and their shared love of adventure. Maybe things weren't so bad after all.",

BRJ Partners had been collaborating with Mazars (a global audit, accounting and consulting group employing more than 26,000 professionals in over 91 countries through member firms with head offices in France), on audit and assurance assignments including both international group audits and regional referrals. These collaboration assignments were aimed at paving the way for BRJ Partners joining the Mazars group. In September 2014, BRJ Partners was accepted as the correspondence firm for Mazars in Uganda bringing a quality accountancy brand servicing hundreds of clients around the world, to Uganda.\nMazars is governed by the Group Executive Board (GEB) which oversees their operational performance management. As their primary executive management body, the Group Executive Board is responsible for the operational management and oversight of the partnership, under the supervision of the Group Governance Council, with regard to their collectively-defined key strategic objectives.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, BRJ Partners was officially incorporated as a member firm of the Mazars Group as Mazars BRJ. BRJ Partners subsequently changed their name to Mazars BRJ.\nMazars BRJ is a multinational subsidiary formed through a partnership. The home offices are stationed in Paris, France and the company has 90 other subsidies. The CEO is Herv\u00e9 H\u00e9lias and the Managing Partner of Uganda is Robert Jack Busuulwa. Mazars BRJ is registered with the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda (ICPAU), the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB), the Uganda Revenue Association (URA), and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) as an accounting firm authorized to provide accounting services to other businesses and individuals. It is a public company limited by shares. \nThey provide a focused team of industry specialists to assist growth-oriented businesses and individuals with audit, accountancy, advisory, tax and legal services.\nMazars BRJ is a sole proprietorship, with a customer base that largely comprises Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). \n1.1.2 Customer Base:\nIn Uganda, a \u2018Micro Enterprise\u2019 is an enterprise employing up to four people, with an annual sales/revenue turnover or total assets not exceeding Uganda shillings 10 million. On one hand, Small Enterprises employ between 5 and 49 and have total assets between UGX 10 million but not exceeding 100 million. The Medium Enterprises, therefore, employ between 50 and 100 with total assets of more than 100 million but not exceeding 360 million. (Uganda Investment Authority, n.d.) \nSMEs are typically labour intensive and with limited investment, because they don\u2019t have heavy or sophisticated machinery or a large capital requirement compared to larger corporations due to their smaller scale of operations. \nAccording to a report by Nathan Associates London Ltd and the Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Uganda, SMEs collectively constitute about 90% of private sector production and employ over 2.5 million people in Uganda. (Financial Sector Deepening Uganda, TNS East Africa and Nathan Associates London, 2015)\n1.1.3 Main Competitors:\nMazars main competitors are other accounting firms. The largest market share is held by the Big4 Accounting Firms; PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst and Young. Below those are other mid-tier firms like Jim Roberts Asssociates, Grant Thornton, and BDO East Africa among others.",

        "prompt": "In addition David J. Collis also adds\nThe Complete Strategy Landscape. Strategy involves more than finding an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. It requires an aligned set of choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success. The entire set of strategic decisions comprises these questions: One: What is our opportunity set? What demographic, political, technological, regulatory, and other environmental changes can we exploit? Two: How can we create the most value? What is our business model? What\u2019s the \u201cjob to be done\u201d for customers? How will we charge for our product or service? What assets do we need to produce and deliver it? Three: How can we capture value? Does the industry structure allow a decent return? What is our positioning? What is the scope of our business? What is its competitive advantage\u2014its unique value proposition and distinctive configuration of activities? How will our rivals react? Four: How do we keep realizing value over the long term? Will our initiatives build the capabilities we need in the long term? Are we organized to adapt to change? Five: How strong is the outcome? Does our performance provide us enough resources to support desirable future moves?\nThe second control mechanism lies in selection of the tactical projects pursued. Here, the CEO must be able to see through the fog of immediate pressures and identify and support a limited number of long-term initiatives that will guide the individual experiments. Typically, these become \u201ccorporate\u201d initiatives, even if in smaller firms nothing that fancy is ever announced. They\u2019re not objectives, since they lack a time frame and specific metrics, but broad themes that govern the sequence, selection, and design of multiple projects. They must be injected into every ongoing change program in the firm that cuts across silos and boundaries.\n\nThese broad initiatives should be manageable in number\u2014probably seven or fewer\u2014so that each can be adequately funded, monitored, and continually promoted. They cannot change regularly; if that happens, they\u2019ll be viewed as \u201cflavors of the month\u201d that can be ignored or met with lip service.\n\nCEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking?\n\nThese higher-level strategic programs must be owned and championed by the CEO. Only the firm\u2019s top leader has the perspective and authority to ensure there\u2019s enough investment in building the capabilities they\u2019ll require. One example is the \u201cdigitalization\u201d initiative at Siemens that Joe Kaeser spearheaded. Another is the Creating the New initiative at Adidas, which Herbert Hainer started and his successor, Kasper R\u00f8rsted, is continuing; it focuses on speed (in order to offer consumers \u201cexactly the products they want to buy whenever, wherever, and however they want to buy\u201d), key strategic cities (to spot emerging trends), and open-source innovation (collaborating with third parties in industry, sports, and entertainment). A third example is Bob Iger\u2019s commitment to invest in quality branded franchises, technology, and globalization during his 14 years at the helm of Walt Disney. Each CEO took personal responsibility for shepherding progress in the chosen areas.\n\nIt is the outcome of these \u201cmust-win\u201d battles that determines long-run success. Though these broad themes or initiatives are not corporate strategies\u2014as they are often mistakenly called\u2014their pursuit is an essential part of a complete strategy.",

A few New Years revelers were still staggering home across the street, and though Tankerbell was a gentle dog, she was strong and quick enough to slip away if she sniffed a stranger she was suddenly interested in meeting. Briony, Tankerbell's and Aru's owner, had almost returned Aru when he was still under warranty and Tankerbell had gotten loose in the neighborhood. But Aru had learned to be more careful since then.

Yeah for sure that That's a lot So I think you know what Never people feel I mean I will die Go first i mean i I am very new to A coordinator role here since learning some things but I have found That's sometimes when There are concerns with patients or was stabbed Doesn't matter what it is sometimes those This little sort of All through the cracks because it's It's too much Work I've heard Just like it's Just like it's not worth the time or the effort to sort of put Put those things in place and I mean In that case it It's usually just because it's Big small so When I do get complaints with it like that they're usually a Bigger nature just big because you know small Things are sort of like a It's not really Working with the current reporting system that we But then that just brings bigger things to my attention so like sometimes patients are aggressive very Be aggressive or very violent and that's something like that will come to you well escalate it through the day levels of management stone That's typically my experience with it I don't know have you had a reportings variants Rebecca I mean we are sort of in volved in the same We've had like one instead Thus far that's stood out to me Where no client was on happy with the service person provided by the practice And it was Due to mouth practice or negligence it was Nearly a side effect that was unpleasant yet spected in the In a scenario And I guess because we don't have a formalized or Reporting System backlight It was best directed to our eggs Creative Director but at the same time He ended up Just kind of leaving And they SQL and started out came a bit and maybe that was very client specific to the situation But I To be honest had He actually sat down with me Deputy Director I'm not sure what would have come Was it would have come of it and if that would have filtered down to the law frontline staff and if something would have changed and And then for me personally like there is a there was a senior Are you aware I kind of did want to Report another staff member and I didn't go about because I didn't know If there was a formalized process Stand Up I was sort of told well You know What's gonna happen if you do You know the outcome that I had hoped then I would hope for crowd He wasn't going to be the outcome and so I just did And So I guess I'd only reinforce is the need to have Some sort of formalized system So thank you Julia Farrelly Would you like to speak to this\n\n20:57\nHi You're gonna say something\n\n20:59\nCaroline As I go into\n\n21:02\nOkay okay\n\n21:03\nno I guess I'm just thinking of like um you When I'm thinking about like reporting and complaints like I do So I work with a lot of folks in the community and doing are we supporting them You know coming out of hospital or x same hospital and I often had a lot of complaints about how they were treated in hospital And in other other community agencies and how centers and so Would that be relevant to like one We're talking about like in terms of reports Are we talking about within just the organization\n\nAlika Lafontaine 21:33\nYes Ma'am\n\n21:33\nlater on Unlike what exactly the software That's\n\nAlika Lafontaine 21:37\nit Yeah so we're taking a bit of a different approach then usual report Warning system so The first is That We're really focused on mitigating risk Not only for The persons who are reporting but all So the systems that they're reporting into I know In the work that we've done with the Friendship centers and I know myself as a Medical leader verta health services sometimes you get reported something and that provide service for you right like a risk of losing a provider if you know something happens to them risk Your relationship with them and so Although that shouldn't matter in the con texting dealing with patient concerns and complaints it doesn't end up mattering because you have to It makes sure that the system still continues working At the same Time is kind of dealing people's can turns in complaints so we Use a pseudo anonymous approach for reporting so that's the First part the second part is that report systems traditionally are stuck Based on the institute So the reporting system is linked to anyone who walks through a hospital but anything else That happens anywhere else is not reported to that hospital So what we're actually Are you looking for a is reporting across systems that follow The patient experience from place to Place command Do you want to jump in here\n\nLeemai Lafontaine 23:00\nyeah I think this is a really Important point so as the legal Saying usually are limited by jurisdiction In the The problem is that in the modern At age most munication is borderless so They may like you in your system but they're actually going I got to Facebook to talk about you and So there's no limits there and So we've had to really change Thinking in terms of what information is relevance for me in inside of my bubble my dress My organization and mice scope of practice We've really just had to Blow that wide open and say no All of this information is readily of NTU because they At one point going to come back to you From a day system and so we have to Thinking about the patient and about the client To the customers that we serve as being a little more holistic than oil them for this so the only complaint has To be within this scenario View This is start To blend together now And so knowing that The system that reporting has to change This is exactly why we get a lot of gridlock in the system because it's just too easy to punt Talk to someone else and say that's not my problem I don't have to deal with that and actually that frustration grows and The person gets frustrated along those different inch The two sections that's when things really started escalate out of control so Just wanted to throw that in there you know we're thinking More borderless Lee In terms of how this information can flow Back to you and even though it may not specifically the relevant internal Have your exact scope and jurisdiction Practice That's what I mean by This middle layer of data that will help inform you and prepare You if that patient ever does come to you for any amount of care Because Have a\n\nAlika Lafontaine 24:51\ngreat day Sir\n\n24:53\nNo I was just gonna say like because we will have some time So I have folks who are like discharged from hospital and they'll come in and like they'll have a complaint and then I'll try to help them call All",

Not just the flow.\nParasocial Fix:\nYeah, but you should type 5 times better then, not 2 times better\n\nXiangyi Li:\nOh, I guess you have to strike a balance between absolute speed and relative comfort when typing. Overall workflow and productivity differs wildly between individuals. My point is like it might be beneficial to have less mental overhead when coding.\nParasocial Fix:\nYeah, steno keyboards are much more ergonomic if you want to spend the whole day typing.

There are no additional changes to make it work for output: export.\n\nhttps://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#static-rendering-default\n\n---\n\nRoute Handlers compatible:\nRoute handlers (route.js / route.ts) can be rendered to a static response at build time if you it only exports GET and doesn't read values from `request`.\n\nRoute handlers that use static rendering are supported in output: export.\n\n---\n\nBuilt-in to `next build`:\nYou no longer have to run `next export`. The output of `next build` will have the `out` directory.\n\n`next export` has mostly been a copying operation, it copies the result from next build static rendering to the `out` directory. Now it's fully built-in.\n---\n\nEnsures development matches static export:\nSince Next.js allows you to use both static and dynamic rendering next export had to warn/error when you used features that need a server, this led to finding out the application couldn't export later on.\n\noutput: export bridges this gap in functionality by giving you feedback during development that a certain feature can't be used when you want to build an application without dynamic rendering.\n\n---\n\nThis is just the beginning, we're working on additional improvements for output: 'export'. e.g. improvements for images.\n\n---\n\nTurn the tweets above delimited by --- into a blogpost",

The system is composed of a four-channel BIS Device, patient interface cable, and BIS sensor, all designed to make bilateral BIS measurements allowing for simultaneous analysis of the EEG information from the two cerebral hemispheres.\n\nThe Bispectral Index (BIS) Module continuously processes a patient\u2019s electroencephalographic (EEG) signal to calculate a single BIS value ranging from 100 (fully awake) to 0 (absence of electrical brain activity). BIS measurement data and trends are intended to be fully integrated into a compatible patient monitor display, including bispectral index, electromyographic strength, signal quality index, suppression ratio, spectral edge frequency, total power, burst count, and EEG. BIS alarms are designed to be signaled audibly and visibly by the monitor to notify clinicians of any significant changes. The Bispectral Index (BIS) Module is designed to provide a measure of the hypnotic effects of anesthetic and sedative agents on the brain. In the operating room, it is used to monitor a patient\u2019s risk of awareness and is intended to reduce hypnotic drug usage, achieve faster wake-up from anesthesia, and have faster qualification for discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). In the intensive care unit, it is used to assess the patient\u2019s level of sedation objectively and is intended to reduce sedative drug usage, decrease the number of ventilation days, and improve patient comfort. \n\nThe Bispectral Index (BIS) Module is intended to be used with IntelliVue MP and MX models of patient monitors.",

This content will serve as a reference guideline for what points should be emphasized as a whole and what content should be included for each section in the table of contents. However, it should be noted that this content should not be included only, and the content should be specified and added around this content.\n\n(1) Overall Direction :\n\n- Keyword of our business plan is Talent transformation. Our business aims to function as a platform that leads the talent transformation of industrial talent. It is a platform that is involved in all directions, from selection and competency prediction for talent development, actual training and efficient operation, to evaluation and expansion into the recruitment market.\n- Udacity has given definitions for 'talent transformation'. Refer to Udacity's definition, business introduction and roadmap, business structure.\n\n(2) Writing Keynote for each Section (According to the order of contents organized in the above \u2018format output\u2019 part) :\n\\*Suppose that this part is feedbacks you\u2019ve given from your upper manager, thus, this content should be well reflected in the final product. Contents that start with '-' under each section are keynote contents that you should refer to. Some sections may not have separate keynotes.\n\n1-a-i) background and problem\n\n- The background largely focused on three things below. Era change, that is, the trend that the 4th industrial revolution and AI era is coming, and secondly, the need for a change in the workforce. As the industry changes, new competencies are also required for the labor force, and the current speed of manpower training and supply is not keeping up with the changes of the times. In addition, companies do not have sufficient responsiveness to perform digital transformation in line with the trend of the times.\n\n1-a-ii) definition and product type (Structure of Talent Transformation)\n\n- Need for a structure of what Talent Transformation is, what needs to be met for successful talent transformation, and what fundamental, core technology and skills are required required in education and talent market regarding talent transformation. (definition and achivement requirements for Talent Transformation)\n- Suggest me clear definition for 'talent transformation' and fundamental technology needed. Refer to Udacity\u2019s details regarding different levels of features and technology required in talent transformation process.\n- As we\u2019ve classified, the types and stages of our business are following :\n(1) competency analysis of talent through DT(digital transformation) competency prediction\n(2)-1 Personalized education according to the required capabilities in digital transformation era (Reskilling & Upskilling), Big data based education curriculum recommendation system\n(2)-2 On-site competency improvement training such as PBL(project-based learning), Transforming Education and Operations innovative with Generative AI\n(3) Competency evaluation model using student big data\n- Our team believes that talent transformation requires understanding of technology, data, education domains, and the recruitment market. After Talent Transformation, it should also be linked to changes in the capabilities of corporate employees. Here are the elements we built up first:\n(1) need to understand the recruitment market (Skills that market needs)\n(2) Modeling the market's required capabilities and headcount measurements (status analysis system for organizations/individuals)\n(3) finally lead to \\*\\*\\*\\*good education\n- Accordingly, the structure defined in this part may need to be presented at a higher level, such as data and educational operation.\n\n1-b-i) Strength and complementary point\n- Strength : Student data, personalized education curriculum based on 4,050 varieties of modularized contents, Education Operational Efficiency based on modularization and use of generative AI\n- complementary point : Rather than a simple weakness, we need to supplement points that lead to our future roadmap. You, BusinessPlanExpert should help ideation about this part, how can we write complementary point as attractive and visionary. Since we refer a lot to the path that Udacity has walked, please refer to it and suggest what we don't have yet, and show it as a roadmap appropriately. Based on the presented information, define the steps to achieve Talent Transformation, refer to our company's strengths, divide what our company has achieved so far and what has not yet reached the level of Udacity, and also create a roadmap in the form of a table.\n\n1-b-ii) core technology\n\n- Here's what we've done so far:\n 1. DT selection competency evaluation technology\n 2. Personalized content recommendation technology\n 3. Competency evaluation model using student data\n 4. Operational efficiency\n Elaborate each points in detail, and suggest several more elements needed as core technology of talent transformation, regarding context of our business.\n\n1-c) Product/service development content and process\n\n- Three elements were presented in previous ideation : student admission model, data accumulation by funnel, B2B expansion and linkage.\nStudent admission model is development of a learning suitability + employment suitability evaluation model that is the basis for competency evaluation.\nWe\u2019ve Collected qualitative cumulative experience data of students through the entire training funnel in bootcamp, and secured corporate data and conducted digital transformation training through B2B business.\n- Refer to this content, but the layer of information should be raised to upper hierarchy. For more higher concept, refer to Udacity\u2019s business/product roadmap information.\n\n1-d) Revenue model, etc.\n\n- Need to make it clear and simple, revenue model should target B2B business, leverage what we\u2019re doing now (B2C business of mass education via KDT) to business model that sells to companies, referring the aforementioned admission/prediction, training operation, and competency evaluation.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\n- We are targeting global market size, because the scale of intensive job transition training covered by our company is already on a global scale, and we have enough capacity to cover global talent transformation.\n- Need top-down valuation and bottom-up valuation. As top-down valuation of market size, give me total global adult Education Market + Job Market. As bottom-up valuation, give me required number of new workforce needed to achieve digital transformation, multiply by the average cost per person for digital transformation. Please show the calculation formula as it is.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\n- Not only global educational platforms, but also include global businesses that could be classified as Talent development/talent incubation market. For example, career transformation platform like LinkedIn may also be included in this requirement. Summarize each company's classification, core characteristics, strengths, innovative technologies, and limitations in a table view\n\n2-b-ii) competitive advantage of Codestates\n\n- Codestates has a competitive edge with unique resources such as long-term training operation know-how and cumulative experience data of students to nurture digital industrial manpower\n- Other players in the market offer similar training and education programs, with much more limited scale and funnels.\n- Global scale bootcamp and amount of data\n\n2-c) Product/service recognition\n\n- Possess the overwhelming number 1 brand in the bootcamp market\n- Service awareness of individual/corporate customers\n- In the case of B2C bootcamp education, adult students from many countries are already receiving our education.\n\n2-d) Marketing and sales plan, etc.\n\n- Bring a global marketing framework (+reference link) that is most suitable for our product/business, and present the global expansion direction and marketing plan according to the framework.\n\n3-a-i) Differentiation and excellence compared to competing products/services\n\n- Holds a lot of student-based data\n- Content with personalized recommendations\n- Operational Efficiency\n\n3-a-ii) Service scalability\n\n- Right now, we are targeting Udacity, but it will become a talent incubation platform beyond LinkedIn. In the end, the important thing in Talent Transformation is the amount of human data. In the future, we believe that companies with educational human data will have an advantage in pursuing a platform, and we believe that we have competitiveness to expand in that respect.\n\n3-b) Technology level and price and quality competitiveness with domestic and foreign competitors' products/services\n\n- Define the latest technology trends related to education and human resources and the technology required for talent transformation \u2192 If the core of the technology is related to data, describe this content by connecting our strengths and characteristics from a data perspective.\n\n3-c) Countermeasures against competitor imitation\n\n- The importance of having your own data\n- we have the largest number of students and accumulating the most diverse and diverse experience data through long-term bootcamp training",

Then in another column, write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru rate for the topic with 120 to a maximum of 155 words. The meta description shall be value-based, so mention the article's value and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click. Do NOT under any circumstance use too generic keywords like introduction or conclusion or tl:dr. Focus on the most specific keywords only. Do not use single quotes, double quotes, or any other enclosing characters in any of the columns you fill in. Do not explain why and what you are doing; return your suggestions in the table.

        "prompt": "Below are questions and answers from an interview with the CEO of \u2018Plastic Arc\u2019, a Cafe24 customer.\nBased on the information below, please write content to be posted on the Cafe24 blog from the perspective of the brand's growth process.\n\nQ: Please tell us the meaning of your brand name.\nAnswer: Ark means Noah's Ark. In a world overflowing with plastic waste, the end of the world is drawing near. So we got the name because we said we would melt this plastic and make a plastic ark to save mankind.\n\nQ: Please tell us how and when you started creating an online shopping mall.\nA: Through the documentary, I realized that environmental problems are much more serious than I thought. One day, thinking that it could have an impact on the end of my life, I decided to take action. Plastic trash is overflowing, but I started a business using waste plastic because I thought I could make a small change with this plastic, which is always around me.\n\nQ: Please tell us about the products you sell and your business overview.\nA: I tried to make environmental protection a cultural trend in order to approach people who are not interested in environmental issues in a friendly way. Since there is nothing that can create a culture as quickly as fashion culture, we are developing a brand by combining fashion. Wanting recycled plastic products to be used closely in daily life, it started as a planter item, launched a cell phone case, and plans to expand to pet products in the future.\n\nQ: What was the hardest thing about running an online shopping mall and how did you overcome it?\nA: It was very difficult to manufacture and commercialize without any expertise in plastics. Waste plastic design pattern technology was a technology that did not exist before, so R&D was almost impossible. I tend to come here on my own, so I translated, read, and studied overseas papers, and I was convinced that it was possible. In the process, I made samples myself and suffered burns all over my body, but I met a company that said it was possible and was able to produce products.\n\nQ: Can you tell us your company's growth story, including key metrics like revenue and membership?\nAnswer: In addition to consumers and followers who were interested in environmental protection, we are experiencing an increase in interest in brands, such as other brands recently taking an interest in plastic arc. Recently, as famous celebrities use Plastic Ark's products, the brand is growing further.\n\nQuestion: What advice would you give to someone starting an online shopping mall?\nAnswer: If you have a desire to do something in your heart, I hope you do it as a movement or as an action, even if it is not necessarily a business. That way, you will not have any regrets later.\n\nQ: How do you differentiate yourself from competing brands?\nA: We are manufacturing products with technology that implements a certain design (pattern) with waste plastic.\nQ: What is the company's future growth strategy and expansion plans?\nAnswer:- The mission of the brand is not simply to produce products by recycling waste plastic, but to achieve the circulation of resources. If you send Plastic Arc products or general plastic containers to Plastic Arc, we operate a reward program that accumulates points on the Plastic Arc website, and we want to activate this. If there is a place where a lot of plastic is consumed and can be collected, such as schools or apartments, we plan to carry out a collaborative project.\n\nQ: Do you have plans to go abroad?\nAnswer: At the start of the business, overseas sales were considered as the focus, but it was held due to various variables (Corona, Ukraine). In the future, Cafe24 plans to carry out full-fledged overseas sales through the English website.",

Karl\n \u00b7 \u2026there are several reference models that would help us align on the size and shape of the opportunity in front of us. For example, do we aspire to be another cloud? A place were performance based/highly interconnected and chatty workloads deserve to reside given the benefits that our customers will reapt. While this maybe fear evoking given the scale of what \u201ccloud\u201d means in the public sense, I think it pushes us to envision a significantly larger oppty that may be in front of us. OR are we looking at simply having a set of virtual services that allow us to sell our current proposition to customers who would prefer to purchase it as a service?\n \u00b7 \u2026anchoring our vision to existing external reference models and declaring the size and share of the oppty we want to own would be key and bold, but would also help to instigate more engagement and creativity by the teams on how/what we need to do to get there. And would highlight the degree of the departure we are truly trying to execute on. Now this can have unintended consequences of scaring those that maybe aligned to the core/legacy value prop, but this should not be the case as both must exist.\n \u00b7 SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING:\u2026yes, to whom are we hoping to win and by when.. meaning, We have tried hard to focus our GTM machine on STAR (high propensity targets) that are generally larger in nature and conform more closely with the type of multinational organizations that will value/and do value our global reach, interconnected ecosystems and service excellence. While this targeted community has grown over the years as we learn more from the customers we have won, and from our teams on the ground, it does not fully capture all startups, or smaller tech companies (for example)that were attracted to the PACKET value prop. Now while I think we have generally aligned around this, I do get a sense that there are factions in the business that disagree and these can be highly influential perspectives that when matched against the STAR focus slows us down.",

The SUS questionnaire consists of 10 statements, each rated on a five-point scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\". The statements are designed to assess the user's perception of the system's usability and overall user experience (e.g. \"I found the system unnecessarily complex\", \"I thought the system was easy to use\", and \"I felt very confident using the system\"). Additionally, we use cognitive walkthroughs, where users are observed while using the system and give a verbal representation of their thought-process while using the system.\n\nThe results of the SUS tests provide information over the overall usability of the system and help identify areas that need improvement. Using SUS is a sensible choice in our case, as it is a well-established and reliable method for measuring the overall usability and user satisfaction of a system. This is important for our IR system at hand, because it should be well-usable for beginner users but still provide high usability also for professional users in the field. Two of our interviewees have explicitly emphasized the importance of ease of use, user-friendliness, and minimal technical jargon, while one user has requested advanced search features, which can be difficult to combine in a user-friendly way. By using SUS, we can obtain valuable feedback from users and identify areas that need improvement. With the cognitive walkthroughs, \n\nFinish!",

The total cost of work that couldnt be done was around $1000, however instead of refunding the $1000 AR system only returned $600. They stated that they added plexiglass instead of a door and that cost $400. In 2022, I was told by liason at AR Systems that the machine was ready to inspect. I hired a technical consultant and flew me and him from dallas, tx to Los angeles, CA to inspect the machine. When we arrived the machine was not done. The wrap was not complete, there was no one available to complete the training as outlined in the contract. Also the machine was not operational and could not be used. Even though there was written communication text and emails concerning the visit, the liason at the company had a funeral and failed to make replacement accomidations or let me know that the visit would not work. later in 2022 the company was sold to a guy named Brian. Brian reported that the machine was not finish and that the previous company undercharged me for the machine. He notified me that to get the machine operational , he need to redo software and hardware snd thst it would cost around $2000. Now it is 2023 and Brian has been ignoring my phone calls on and off naiss for about 3 weeks. He has said when I have called from other number that he would get back in touch with me and doesnt.

Instead of an app, a way to test this could be YouTube ads to people in early 20s living in Minneapolis that say if they wanna meet people they can give phone number / email or sign up on a link where they give a bit of info on themselves / interests / photo / contact info (can be a google form that goes to a google sheets database. Then, we charge people say $50-100 for access to the info on people that wanna meet people. So flow is: ad, landing page with free version (so they don\u2019t get to fill form till paying for full version and can understand how / why etc it works, we can say we make ppl pay so you don\u2019t waste time with people who aren\u2019t serious/ responsive), then they can click link to pay, payment screen, then link to full version. All the work is on other people to reach out, which is good cause then it feels more natural.

Rainy weather, a few gps misalignments here and there, and a few noted departures/retirements already set the stage for employees to be unhappy.\n\nThe facebook phenomenon creates a real retention problem, I now realize, not just because of FB's direct hiring but the more insidious effect that everyone wants to start the next facebook or get rich by having a popular fb app. Whether fb itself does well or not is hard to predict but it is clear to me that there is a social networking bubble of imitations and tag alongs.\n\nFinally, we (or basically I) have not done a good enough job of high rewards for high performance.

        "prompt": "Here's another personal statement that's considered excellent for college admissions. Can you highlight multiple reasons why it worked well (in bullet point format)?\n\nPersonal Statement:\nLIFE AS AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT\nAt six years old, I stood locked away in the restroom. I held tightly to a tube of toothpaste because I\u2019d been sent to brush my teeth to distract me from the commotion. Regardless, I knew what was happening: my dad was being put under arrest for domestic abuse. He\u2019d hurt my mom physically and mentally, and my brother Jose and I had shared the mental strain. It\u2019s what had to be done.\n\nLiving without a father meant money was tight, mom worked two jobs, and my brother and I took care of each other when she worked. For a brief period of time the quality of our lives slowly started to improve as our soon-to-be step-dad became an integral part of our family. He paid attention to the needs of my mom, my brother, and me. But our prosperity was short-lived as my step dad\u2019s chronic alcoholism became more and more recurrent. When I was eight, my younger brother Fernando\u2019s birth complicated things even further. As my step-dad slipped away, my mom continued working, and Fernando\u2019s care was left to Jose and me. I cooked, Jose cleaned, I dressed Fernando, Jose put him to bed. We did what we had to do.\n\nAs undocumented immigrants and with little to no family around us, we had to rely on each other. Fearing that any disclosure of our status would risk deportation, we kept to ourselves when dealing with any financial and medical issues. I avoided going on certain school trips, and at times I was discouraged to even meet new people. I felt isolated and at times disillusioned; my grades started to slip.\n\nOver time, however, I grew determined to improve the quality of life for my family and myself.\n\nWithout a father figure to teach me the things a father could, I became my own teacher. I learned how to fix a bike, how to swim, and even how to talk to girls. I became resourceful, fixing shoes with strips of duct tape, and I even found a job to help pay bills. I became as independent as I could to lessen the time and money mom had to spend raising me.\n\n I also worked to apply myself constructively in other ways. I worked hard and took my grades from Bs and Cs to consecutive straight A\u2019s. I shattered my school\u2019s 1ooM breaststroke record, and learned how to play the clarinet, saxophone, and the oboe. Plus, I not only became the first student in my school to pass the AP Physics 1 exam, I\u2019m currently pioneering my school\u2019s first AP Physics 2 course ever.\n\nThese changes inspired me to help others. I became president of the California Scholarship Federation, providing students with information to prepare them for college, while creating opportunities for my peers to play a bigger part in our community. I began tutoring kids, teens, and adults on a variety of subjects ranging from basic English to home improvement and even Calculus. As the captain of the water polo and swim team I\u2019ve led practices crafted to individually push my comrades to their limits, and I\u2019ve counseled friends through circumstances similar to mine. I\u2019ve done tons, and I can finally say I\u2019m proud of that. \n\nBut I\u2019m excited to say that there\u2019s so much I have yet to do. I haven\u2019t danced the tango, solved a Rubix Cube, explored how perpetual motion might fuel space exploration, or seen the World Trade Center. And I have yet to see the person that Fernando will become. \n\nI\u2019ll do as much as I can from now on. Not because I have to. Because I choose to.",

        "prompt": "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n RULE #5\n Use the Power in Your Posterior\n From Jeremy\nPossibly the most overlooked bit of anatomy, for back pain, is your backside. We are talking about your butt and especially your glutes, the big muscles that constitute most of your butt. The difficulty is that, in modern times, we have mostly used our glutes to sit on. They have atrophied as a result. The use of the buttocks exclusively as a seat cushion is a recent development in evolutionary terms, and a rotten one. It is handy, lord knows, but that wasn\u2019t the original design idea, and we are paying a horrendous price for it, mostly in back pain. \nLetting your glutes go to hell in idleness (\u201cgluteal amnesia,\u201d as the great student of back pain Dr. Stuart McGill called it) is an absolutely dreadful idea. By all means, continue to sit on them. But do much, much more, too. Remember that the glutes are the biggest muscles in your body, they have serious loads to bear, and it is critical that we let them do it. Because, if we don\u2019t, our spines (and the tiny muscles around them) will carry those loads, and they are not designed for it. They protest . . . they hurt. And they will continue to hurt until you wake up your glutes and let them do their job. \nThe gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles that make up the buttocks. There are several smaller muscles back there as well, including the piriformis. They look like this (see diagram below). \nIn a healthy person, the gluteal muscles perform a bunch of important functions. Here\u2019s what they should be doing: \n\u2022 helping you to stand up and maintain erect posture \n\u2022 keeping you from falling forward when you walk or run \n\u2022 keeping your pelvis from collapsing when you are standing on one leg or walking when only one foot is in contact with the ground \n\u2022 helping you to rise from a seated position \n\u2022 helping you pick things up \n\u2022 helping you climb stairs, ski, run, row\u2014and that old favorite, make love\nGluteal Muscles\n\nAll kinds of things. Obviously, these are some of the most important things you do and these are some of the most important muscles in your body. \nWhen you let your glutes go to sleep, things get bad. They \u201cforget\u201d all those critical functions, and the muscles that take up the slack are not up to the job. As we compress the muscles (by sitting on them), nerves and blood vessels in the gluteal muscle don\u2019t work as well. Our brain literally loses its connectivity with them. The muscles, and the neural pathways, atrophy (or \u201close preference\u201d); the brain \u201cforgets\u201d them. Hence, the term gluteal amnesia. In my experience, there is a very high correlation between the glutes going to sleep and back pain. Very high.\nHere\u2019s why: When those big powerful muscles aren\u2019t doing their job, the spine takes over. It bears the brunt of the forces that the glutes are supposed to be handling and it gets overwhelmed and damaged. Instead of using those big muscles to do things like pick up your child or grandchild, you first use the tiny muscles around your spine to do them, and those muscles can\u2019t handle it. They become strained (which causes pain, all by itself) and eventually fail. Then things get quite a bit worse. When those little muscles fail, the forces that your glutes were supposed to be handling get transmitted directly onto your discs, joints, ligaments, and tendons. That is not what they are supposed to do and it causes serious problems. Conversely, those big psoas muscles get reflexively tighter, putting more pressure on the spine. Think about it: Every time you get out of a chair, pick something up, tie your shoe, or climb the stairs, you are putting a ton of pressure on your spine that it is not designed to bear. You can do it for a while. You can do almost anything for a while. But over the days, months, and years, these micro irritations add up to macro damage. Remember Chris\u2019s explanation of \u201cgeologic time\u201d? Mountains are ground down to rubble in geologic time. Your spine is ground down to rubble in your own version of geologic time, if your glutes don\u2019t do their job.\nSummary: Letting your glutes go to sleep is a terrible idea. Reversing that process and waking them up is crucial to healing back pain. Once those muscles wake up and start doing their intended work, the muscles that do the opposite motion on the joint, the psoas muscles, reflexively loosen up. If you didn\u2019t know this, don\u2019t feel bad. A lot of therapists and doctors don\u2019t know it, either. Or don\u2019t treat it effectively. Teaching you how to treat the problem effectively is one of the most important things we do in this book. \nHere\u2019s what you need to do, in three steps: Wake up your glutes, make them strong, and learn to use them at the appropriate times, as they were designed to be used. \nPART ONE: WAKING UP THE SLEEPING GIANTS\nYou tried using your glutes with the bridge exercise. Now let\u2019s try a different way to wake them up. If you had trouble with the bridge, don\u2019t worry. We will come back to that shortly. \nClamshell\nNow, on to the all-important \u201cclamshell\u201d exercise. It is critical\u2014boring and often poorly performed, but it wakes up and strengthens your glutes.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your hips and knees bent as shown.\nStep 2: Take the thumb of your top hand and dig it inside your upper hip bone, as in the drawing. \nStep 3: Lay the four fingers of that hand across the outside of your hip, as in the picture. \nStep 4: For most of you, your middle finger (or first or third) will be lying right on the gluteal muscles we are trying to wake up. Poke your fingers in there and feel them. Reestablish that connection with your brain. Keep your fingers there.\n\nStep 5: Find your neutral spine and brace your core.",

I only want you to reply \"acknowledged\" to remember the third I will give you further instructions after this.\n\nMutual termination or cancellation of a building contract\nFind out more about the use of a deed of termination when terminating or cancelling a building contract.\nCancelling or terminating a building contract is a significant step which should not be taken lightly.\nBefore taking any formal steps to end a building contract, you should talk to your client and see if you can reach an agreement to mutually end the contract.\nAny agreement to terminate a contract should be put in writing. One way to do this is through a deed of mutual termination.\nHow is a contract terminated?\nA contract can be terminated in a number of ways, including by performance, breach, agreement, frustration or by law. In the building industry, contracts are more commonly terminated by performance, breach or agreement.\n\nTermination by performance\nA contract will come to its natural end when both parties have performed or completed all of their duties and obligations under the contract. A deed is not required in this instance.\n\nTermination by breach\nAn innocent party may terminate a contract, depending on the terms of the contract, as a result of a breach by the other party.\n\nTermination by agreement\nThe parties mutually agree to terminate the contract for any other reason. A deed of mutual termination may be used for both a termination by breach and termination by agreement.\n\nWhat is a deed of mutual termination?\nA deed of mutual termination is a separate written binding legal document which confirms both parties mutual intention to cancel the original contract.\n\nThe deed will bring the parties responsibilities and obligations under the contract to an end and depending on the terms of the deed, will relieve them of carrying out any obligations that would have otherwise arisen under the contract in the future.\n\nWhen should I use a deed of mutual termination?\nA deed of mutual termination should be used when:\n\nBoth parties agree to end the contract and there is still something required to be completed under the contract such as payment, building works or rectification of defects;\nThe parties do not want to trigger any clause which may ordinarily arise as a result of termination, for example the deed may allow the parties to avoid issuing formal breach notices and formal termination which may lead to claims for costs and damages by one party; or\nThe contract does not provide a right to terminate.\nCase Study\nA builder and home owner entered into a building contract;\nWhilst the works were on foot, the builder and the home owner entered into a dispute regarding the completion date for the works;\nThe home owner and the builder agree to terminate the contract, however as works are incomplete, a deed of mutual termination is appropriate to record:\nthe terms of any payment to be made by the home owner to the builder for the works completed;\nthe requirements for the builder to complete any works;\nthe works the builder will not be required to complete; and\nthat the home owner has agreed not to pursue the builder for anything that the builder would have otherwise been liable for under the contract, including requirements to rectify defects or provide statutory warranties for works not completed.\nWhat should be included in a deed?\nThe terms of a deed will vary depending on a range of factors such as the stage of works at which termination will occur, any money owing or agreed to be paid, any further works required to be carried out prior to termination or any defects to be rectified.\n\nBelow are just some examples of the type of details that should be included:\n\nImportant background details\nBackground details, known as \u2019recitals\u2019 are not required for a deed, but can be useful in providing the background to the agreement.\n\nThe background details are often used to interpret the parties intention when entering into the agreement.\n\nAccordingly, it is important that the recitals contain the key facts that describe the circumstances leading to the parties agreeing to enter into the deed.\n\nRelease\nParties may agree to release and waive one another from any claims relating to the subject matter (i.e. the building contract).\n\nThe parties cannot demand performance of any outstanding obligations or claim damages.\n\nPreventing either party from bring any further actions\nA \u2018bar to action\u2019 or \u2018bar to proceedings\u2019 clause is critical as it prevents the parties from bringing any further action, claim or demands in relation to the terminated contract.\n\nResponsibility for any future losses that might arise under the original contract\nA \u2018no waiver\u2019 clause may be included in a deed to allow one party to take action against the other if they have breached the original contract. These types of clauses can have serious implications on you as the execution of the deed does not prevent a claim being made for a breach of the original contract and does not necessarily mean that the matter has come to an end.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you seek legal advice in the event you receive a deed with a \u2018no waiver\u2019 or similar clause.\n\nSettlement Payment\nWhere one party is to pay a sum of money to the other party, there should be clear terms identifying:\n\nThe sum of money to be exchanged\nThe date and method of payment\nWhat happens in the event of non-payment (for example, the party can commence legal proceedings to recover the sum of money or claim interest on the settlement sum)\nThat the settlement payment is made in full and final settlement of the parties\u2019 dispute.\nMutual Disparagement\nA mutual disparagement clause may be important if parties have been involved in a lengthy dispute or the relationship has broken down. This clause prevents either parties from \u201cbad-mouthing\u201d the other or damaging the others reputation.\n\nConfidentiality\nGenerally, the terms of a deed should be kept confidential and this will be stipulated in a confidentiality clause. This requires both parties to keep the terms of the deed confidential and may include the terms of the contract.\n\nWhat happens if a breach of the deed occurs?\nBreach of a deed may give the innocent party the right to commence legal proceedings to recover damages for any loss suffered as a result of the breach.\n\nBeware, deeds will not release you from all obligations\nAll statutory obligations and warranties provided by a builder to a home owner will continue to apply following the termination of a contract and cannot be contracted out of.",

Each hero was known for their unique skills, powers, and abilities, and they were revered by the people of the land as protectors and champions. They were constantly called upon to embark on quests to vanquish foes and defend the realm from evil forces.\n\nAt the same time, there was another group of adventurers, who were dedicated to documenting encounters with fantastical creatures in the world. They were fascinated by mythical beasts such as dragons, unicorns, griffins, and other enchanted creatures. They sought to explore their habitats, abilities, and behaviors, and uncover the mysteries surrounding these creatures.\n\nOne day, the kingdom was threatened by an evil force led by a powerful sorcerer. The king called upon the legendary heroes to embark on a quest to stop the sorcerer and save the kingdom. The heroes, determined to protect the people they loved, gathered together and set out on their journey.\n\nAt the same time, the group of adventurers encountered a dragon in a far-off land. They were amazed by the dragon's size, strength, and the fire it breathed. They carefully documented the dragon's behavior and habitats, and they even managed to communicate with it to learn more about its abilities and motivations.\n\nThe heroes, meanwhile, continued on their quest, facing countless challenges and overcoming fierce battles along the way. As they journeyed deeper into the realm, they discovered that the sorcerer was using forbidden magic to increase his power. Undeterred, the heroes continued their quest, determined to put a stop to the evil once and for all.\n\nAs the heroes reached the sorcerer's lair, the group of adventurers encountered a griffin in a lush forest. They were amazed by the griffin's speed and agility, and they were fascinated by the way it could fly. They carefully documented the griffin's behavior and habitats, and they even managed to communicate with it to learn more about its abilities and motivations.\n\nFinally, the heroes engaged the sorcerer in a fierce battle and, despite his immense power, the heroes were able to defeat him and bring peace back to the kingdom. The group of adventurers, meanwhile, continued their journey, discovering more enchanted creatures and documenting their encounters.\n\nWith their quest complete, the heroes returned home as legends, celebrated and revered by the people they had protected. The group of adventurers, meanwhile, continued to share their findings with the world, uncovering the mysteries surrounding these enchanted creatures and capturing their adventures for all to see.\n\nAnd so, the adventures of these legendary heroes and the encounters with enchanted creatures became the stuff of legend in the fantasy world, inspiring others to embark on their own epic journeys and discover the magic and wonder of this enchanting realm.",

Contracts Specialist regularly deals with similar cases and variations of these.\nSample Case 1: The Unlicensed Builder\n540x350\\_Tools\nA builder was claiming that he was a licensed maintenance contractor and said he could operate as a home builder on contracts exceeding $500,000.00. When the construction works completed, a building consultant inspected the outputs and concluded that the works were poorly carried out.\n\nThey eventually found out that the builder could only work to a maximum value of $6,000.00 but has received $300,000.00 as payment for his work. The homeowner failed to locate the builder and to recover the money. In the end, the homeowner suffered from a significant financial loss.\n\nSample Case 2: Variations to Contract\n540x350\\_Contract\nThe contract was both agreed upon by the homeowners and builder. They accepted each demand and changed some statements in the contract. At the end of the project, the homeowners were happy with the outcome of the work. However, there was one thing they did not like \u2013 the balustrades.\n\nThe homeowners insisted that those were different from the ones in the contract. So, they sought a refund of the variation amount. The builder argued that the homeowner should not be entitled to a refund since there was no loss of amenity. Eventually, the case was resolved and the homeowners got the refund they had requested.\n\nPlease reply \u201cacknowledged\u201d only once received \nPlease write in English language.",

        "prompt": "what does slantchev means on his paper entitled state and anarchy when he says: The Genesis of the Modern State System\nWhere do the modern states come from? Tradition dates the creation of the\nmodern state system with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. This treaty ended\nthe Thirty Years War, which was actually a series of wars over religious,\nterritorial, dynastic, and commercial issues. It started when the Catholic king\nof Bohemia Ferdinand II attempted to impose his religion on his Protestant\nnobles. Soon Denmark and Sweden got involved, along with Poland and Russia.\nIn the end, the main alliances solidified around religious lines, pitting the\nCatholic Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, against a group\nof Protestant towns and territories aided by Sweden and Netherlands. Waged\nmostly in German territories, the war was grievously costly and the devastation\n\u2013 immense.\nThe treaty distributed territories (mostly to Sweden, France, and their allies)\nand confirmed the sovereignty over them. It also confirmed or extended\nreligious toleration to Lutherans and Calvinists within the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn Germany, central authority was replaced by sovereignty of about 300\nprinces and the weak confederation persisted until the unification more than\nthree centuries later.\nThere have been many other wars and treaties before the Peace of Westphalia.\nThere have been many other large-scale political organizations before that as\nwell. Why do we privilege 1648 then? Because Westphalia marked the\ntransition from a system of overlapping feudal loyalties toward a system\nincorporating the principle of sovereignty. Sovereignty refers to the principle\nof complete authority within a territory. That is, it provides for an entity that\ncommands the loyalty of its subjects. This entity was called the state, an\nabstract notion that referred to the legal standing of the ruler.\nPrior to 1648, Britain and France looked like sovereign states because they\nboth had kings who wielded power within their territories. But the situation in\nthe rest of Europe was quite different. After the fall of the Roman empire,\npolitical entities were local, organized along feudal lines, and with little or no\ninteraction among themselves. The Catholic Holy Roman Empire formally\nencompassed almost all of Central Europe but its ruler did not have\nsovereignty over its various members: by the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, local\nGerman princes could impose their own religion within their territories. The\nsystem was unstable because of conflicting claims of authority over the same\nterritories and their inhabitants. It was this that led to the Thirty Years War.\nThe Westphalian system enshrined the state as the sole form of authority in\nEurope that neither the Holy Roman Empire nor the Pope could challenge (which explains why Pope Innocent X blasted the treaties as \u201cnull, void, invalid,\niniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect\nfor all time.\u201d) The local rulers could freely align diplomatically with whoever\nthey wished, they could organize they commerce and trade as they saw fit.\nAlthough intervention did not cease, the treaty brought to an end the\nintervention based on religious matters, removing what had been the prime\ncause of war in Europe for the preceding two centuries. Before discussing\nsovereignty in some detail, it is worth taking a look at the movement toward a\nnation-state. That is, a state that encompasses a nation",

        "prompt": "Read this: Honey & Your Skin:\nHoney is a great beauty ingredient for your face, hair, and body. It\u2019s gentle enough for sensitive skin, yet it cleans and moisturizes without stripping moisture from the skin.\n\nHoney has been used as a beauty product for centuries. It\u2019s an all-around great ingredient to add to your beauty routine.\n\nHoney is rich in vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that nourish and moisturize skin. It also contains antimicrobial properties that help keep bacteria away from the skin.\n\n \n\nHere are five reasons to add honey to your beauty routine:\n1. Honey is the perfect daily cleanser. Honey naturally helps cleanse the skin by removing dirt and makeup without leaving behind any residue or dryness.\n\n2. It can reduce wrinkles by up to 30 percent over time. Research shows that honey has anti-aging benefits for mature skin thanks to its antioxidant properties, which help reduce damage caused by free radicals in the body. Honey also contains proteins that help boost collagen production, which makes it effective against fine lines and wrinkles on the face as well as other parts of the body like hands and feet!\n\n3. It\u2019s a natural exfoliator. Honey is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture out of the air and onto your skin. This also makes it an effective exfoliator. You can use honey as an all-natural alternative to commercial chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid or retinol.\n\n4. It treats acne and blemishes naturally with no side effects! A 2012 study found that honey has antibacterial properties that make it effective at treating acne breakouts without causing scarring or damage to healthy tissue as traditional antibiotics can do. Honey hydrates and softens skin. It has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce redness and irritation, so it\u2019s great for sensitive skin.\n\n5. It soothes sunburns and burns caused by chemical peels or laser treatments (but don\u2019t try this at home). When applied topically, honey could soothe inflammation caused by sunburns or burns due to chemical peels or laser treatments because of its anti-inflammatory properties; however, avoid using raw honey straight out of the jar on open wounds as it may cause irritation instead of soothing.\n\nHow to use honey as a face mask or exfoliator:\nsoak your face in water that is warm enough to open your pores. Next pour some honey out into your hand and with your other hand, take some honey in your fingers and massage it into your face using circular motions. Continue until your whole face is covered in honey. Unlike other chemical masks, you can use honey close to your eyes. Lay your head back and let the honey sit on your skin for 5 to 20 minutes, then rinse with warm water and pat dry. \n\n \n\nHow to use Honey in Your Hair:\nsimply massage the honey into your scalp and work your way down the length of your hair all the way to the ends, making sure not to miss any sections. once the honey has been fully massaged into your scalp and is covering your hair down to the ends, all the honey to sit in your hair for anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours and rinse using a mild shampoo. Repeat once or twice a week until you have reached your desired results.",

Please do this without erasing any of the facts or details in the essay. \n\nthe essay: Far East of New York in Bermuda lies one of North America\u2019s most influential nations and island countries, New Pangea. The country holds promising social achievements as well as many economic and technological accomplishments that have been recognized internationally for nearly centuries. \n\nThe island country was once exclusively inhabited by its natives referred to as \u201cKraenons\u201d. Despite their lack of appearance in any historical events with other countries before their English encounters, the Kraenons were fully capable of creating their own technology and advanced mathematics (Though interestingly, there have been no accounts of the Kraenons seeking out foreign civilization before they were discovered). After merging a large majority of the population with English settlers over nearly a century, a newly formed Pangean culture would take hold of the country. Pangean culture amalgamates many aspects of 1600s English and Kraenon culture such as the Kraenon \u201cBristle week\u201d and English \u201cChristmas\u201d. Pangeans hold a deeply devotional respect for birds, it is not uncommon to find residents of the country preparing bird seeds for native birds to feast. Over the 20th century, New Pangea experienced massive influence from western and European cultures, especially in technology and architecture such as the popularity of the telephone and television as well as homes with white exteriors and rectangular windows. Among the many cultural practices in New Pangea, one of the most followed and respected values in families and communities across the country are the benefits and regard for education, education is commonly viewed as the only path to success within the general population. New Pangea\u2019s educational philosophy is taken seriously even by the youth of the country who view subjects such as math or science as challenging entertainment rather than a forced subject of no interest. \n\nDue to New Pangea's deep cultural beliefs in education, schools across the country receive up to 20% of the country\u2019s yearly budget, or up to 100,000,000 PAN (125,000,000 CAD). Due to New Pangea's comparatively high wealth:population ratio when compared to other developed countries, students are offered much higher quality education from much more qualified educators. Many classes in Pangean schools are held outdoors to maintain the mental state of students while they learn, homework in the country is also regularly minimized to only long-term projects for certain subjects, keeping students from stress and allowing them to enjoy their time outside of school as well as giving them a task to complete over time. As of 2022, New Pangea\u2019s education has been successful enough to maintain a 1250 SAT score average as well as a 84% college/university graduation rate among the population above the age of 24.\n\nAs well as high cultural regard for education, families in New Pangea show respect through a variety of customs and practices. Pangeans are expected to bow when greeted in consideration of others, especially their parents or the elderly. It is also expected that Pangeans respect and obey their parents. In addition to many practices of social courtesy and belief, Pangeans follow a strict philosophy of respect for their natural environment. Socially unaccepted yet foreignly common bad habits in this regard such as littering or vandalizing are disputed as contentious and controversial, this etiquette is largely believed to be owed to the nation's vast reverence for birds of the country\u2019s wild. The population's cultural connection with nature has also given a noticeable impact on the laws in the country. In 2008, the New Pangea National Congress would pass the \u201cNew Atomica\u201d bill, which would successfully demolish the use of fossil fuels nationwide by 97.4% by 2015, the countries main source of energy since and before has been nuclear energy sourced from Atomica Industries, raising safety concerns which have yet to be dealt with. In 2014, New Pangea National Congress would then pass the \u201cGreen Pangea\u201d bill which would mandate recycling bins to be put across the country, as well as basic education on recycling waste in both public and private schools.\n\nThe living standards of New Pangea are comparably higher in comparison with other developed nations. All youth are legally required and provided to participate in the country\u2019s education which has been ranked the highest globally by organizations such as the Global Citizens For Human Rights. The social democratic system implemented into New Pangea\u2019s economy allows even the lowest financial classes of the country to be provided with a healthy amount of food and water as well as shelter and healthcare all without the burden of financial stress. Because of these factors, the people of New Pangea live comfortable lives where their health is almost always independent of their class. Children in the country do not have to work to provide for their families financially, allowing children in New Pangea to be given time for study, creativity and entertainment. Adults in New Pangea are driven to work by and for the nation\u2019s capitalist economy in order to afford the luxuries (food, homes, technology\u2026) provided by the economy. For the less fortunate, the government provides centralized but rationed food, water and shelter as well as fully covered healthcare. Though it is more common to live in privately owned properties, New Pangea\u2019s government offers tax-paid shelters called \u201cGovernment Residential Buildings\u201d to the homeless population, though these homes are not considered luxurious or even comfortable for some, it meets the mental and physical standards for those who choose to live in them. The typical middle class worker in New Pangea works from morning (9-11AM) to evening (6-9PM) and is paid on average 24.5 CAD an hour, more than enough to be both financially stable and mentally comfortable in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe economy of New Pangea is fueled by the country\u2019s 3 big industries, the Seafood industry, Mining industry and Technology industry. Just like other Island countries, New Pangea is the home of some of the world's most exotic and profitable seafood businesses, namely \u201cJontora seafoods\u201d, the world's largest seafood company which made approximately 45,000,000,000 CAD in 2022 (Though the company originated in New Pangea, it has many sister locations put internationally). The Seafood industry in New Pangea also contributes to the country\u2019s alluring tourist industry which made 70,000,000,000 CAD in 2022. The biggest driving factors of New Pangea\u2019s economic growth are the country\u2019s mining and technology industry. Since the 1960s, Atomica Industries (which is government owned) has been mining tonnes of uranium among other valuable minerals in Morriloe Island, creating a net profit of 400,176,100 CAD from mining alone in 2022. Atomica Industries as well as other Pangean companies such as Mei-Plye-technologies have accounted for the country\u2019s technological advancements in Nuclear technology, Medical technology and AI/computer technology. Technological exports from the country made net profit of approximately 1,000,000,000,000 CAD in only 2022, this is largely owed to the country\u2019s abundance of metal from Morriloe Island as well as a national emphasis on education. In recent years, technology has seen a steep improvement worldwide, opening an opportunity for the already thriving tech industry of New Pangea to blossom in now growing fields such as quantum computing, AI technology and more.",

What degrees can one get at a higher educational establishment?\n\n7. What is the structure of an institute or a university?\n\n8. How can you prove that education in Russia is going through a transitional period?\n\nAnswer these questions. they refer to this text:\nRussians have always shown a great concern for education. The right to education is stated in the Constitution of the educational Russian Federation. It is ensured by compulsory secondary schools, Vocational schools, and higher establishments. It is also ensured by the development of extra- mural and evening courses and the system of state scholarships and grants. Education in Russia is compulsory to the 9th form inclusive. The stages of compulsory schooling in Russia are: 2primary education for ages 6-7 to 9-10 inclusive; secondary education including intermediate school for ages 10-11 to 12-13 inclusive, and senior high school for ages 13-14 to 14-15 inclusive. If a pupil of a secondary school wishes to go on in higher education, he or she must stay at school for two more years. Primary and secondary school together comprise 11 years of studies. Every school has a \"core curriculum\" of academic subjects, such as Russian, literature, mathematics, history, a foreign language and others. Lyceums and gymnasiums offer programs giving a profound knowledge in some field of study. After finishing the 9th form one can go on to a vocational school which offers programmes of academic subjects and a programme of training in a technical field, or a profession. After finishing the 11th form of a secondary school, a lyceum or a gymnasium one can go on in higher education. All applicants must taken competitive examinations. Higher educational institutions, that is, institutes, academies or universities, offer a 5-year programme of academic subjects in a variety of fields, as well as a graduate course. If one finishes a graduate course and writes a thesis, he or she receives the candidate degree, corresponding to the master's degree, or the doctoral degree. Higher educational establishments are headed by Rectors. Prorectors are in charge of academic and scientific work. An institute or a university has a number of faculties, each specializing in a field of study. Faculties have specialized councils which confer candidate and doctoral degrees. The system of secondary and higher education in Russia is going through a transitional period. As a result of it Russia took part in the international reform of higher education and signed the Bologna Declaration in 2003. The main objectives of the reform are: to decentralize the higher education system, to develop a new financial mechanism, to give more academic freedoms to faculties and students, (to introduce two stages of education in higher institutions - Baccalaureate and Magistrate, to increase Russian higher education competitiveness on the world scale. Now Russia completes the integration into the European Higher Educational Area. All secondary schools, institutes, academies and universities until recently have been funded by the state. Now there is quite a number of private fee-paying primary and secondary schools; some universities have fee-paying departments.",

Bruce\n \u00b7 Hesitancy to fail \n \u00b7 Alignment on timeframes\n \u00b7 Operating model: Our new products cannot exist without the legacy platform and the legacy platform is unlikely to scale without integration of new products. (feels we are on a good path on this one, but still a gap in my view)\n \n3. Charles\n \n4. Jon\n \u00b7 Financial tracking of investments in new/growth areas is undisciplined and poorly tracked vs business case\n \u00b7 Greater understanding of software architecture and development principals amongst senior leadership \u2013 design thinking and agile mindsets\n \n5. Justin\n \u00b7 Significant technical debt\n \u00b7 Engineering skills gap (architecture design, software-first, agile, DevOps, cloud native, etc.)\n \u00b7 Ownership and accountability mechanisms \n \n6. Karl\n \u00b7 \u2026.Talent, tech stack, know how, time\n \u00b7 Our back office systems are slow, rigid and complex.. if the vision is to have an AND strategy where we offer both digital and physical, WE must attack our underlying systems. \n \n7. Keith\n \u00b7 I\u2019m not sure I should say this \u2026but I\u2019m not yet convinced that we have the right team on the field to win the game, but I do believe we can score a goal. Investing in the right leadership, at scale, and playing to win. \n \u00b7 Keep the finance guys away from the decision \u2013 focus on the execution and the money will follow. Or said differently, allow the team to be comfortable that we\u2019re making an investment, which may not pay off and thus, plan for it.\n \u00b7 Be more targeted in our investments \u2013 don\u2019t spread ourselves too thin or dilute our offering. Put the wood behind the arrow! \n \n8. Kurt\n \u00b7 \u2026. I am not sure I have much to add above, but I do think eteam alignment is a big gap. We tend to leave the full vision and decisions to Scott (and let\u2019s remember he is new, overwhelmed likely with a team that isn\u2019t always fit for purpose) when the topic comes up at eStaff. But this is our joint strategy and we should not leave it to Scott alone to do his best to make a strategy. I don\u2019t think that is fair to Scott or to the business. This will require us to find the right escalation things to talk about which for me, in the short term, are the \u201cwhats\u201d that we are building. We have a team that once they have a clear decision can act. This will need to be more detailed in the short term as there is an expectation set that all decisions come to eteam and so I think its hard to get resolution without eteam saying \u201cour guidance at 50k feet is X, Scotts at 40k feet is Y and we trust our leaders to take the rest and come back to us if X and Y are not clear enough.\u201d \n \n9. Mike\n \u00b7 Being able to articulate what we need for the Product team to build.\n \u00b7 Understanding how committed our big partners like Dell and VMWare are to these partnerships.\n \u00b7 Still don\u2019t have a lot of expertise in our Metal offerings that reside in Product or Engineering.\n \n10. Milind\n\n11. Nicole \n \u00b7 People, Workforce, Brand: \n \u00b7 No clear Northstar for the workforce to clearly understand where we are going and the role they play. The company needs a rally cry and \u201cdestination\u201d to inspire the transformation. \n \u00b7 Shift in mindset and willingness to change. I believe this has to start top down and all of us within Estaff need to align on the critical goals. Need full alignment in Estaff and clear messaging to their teams on the non-negotiables so the messages across all functions are the same. Today, they are not. \n \u00b7 No specific leader in marketing dedicated to leading the charge on external brand shaping for the future. Do we need a formal CMO? \n \n \u00b7 Growth and Bookings\n \u00b7 Major fires in EODB journey (ease of doing business). We have to create E2E customer experience that sales has confidence in and is willing to sell to customer set. \n \u00b7 Shift in salesforce from space and power sellers to solution sellers. Need aggressive enablement, pipeline discipline and incentives/rewards clearly tied to the transformation goals. \n \u00b7 Simplified product (and pricing) portfolios moving us towards less bespoke/custom sales motions and more scale oriented sales motions. (IE: Why have we not doubled down on secure cab express and made that mandatory where we can?) \n \u00b7 No clear strategic direction how to achieve scale through distinct sets of partners. Partner motion today still feels mainly like a \u201csell with colo oriented\u201d motion. We need to get clarity on a partner strategy that can help scale our digital infrastructure services more effectively. \n i. Should we focus on software players (IE: VMW, Redhat) ?\n ii. ISV\u2019s (IE: ServiceNow) ?\n iii. OEM\u2019s (Dell, HPE, etc.. )? \n \u00b7 System, Tools and Processes\n \u00b7 Lack of structured, focused (and aligned) internal digital transformation plan. (That said, I believe we can change this quickly if we get better aligned on strategic vision). We have to get acutely focused on the right things in IT. \n \u00b7 Do not yet have a strong customer and care experience supporting customers that want to purchase solutions (who want to buy multiple services together). Today there are significant breakdowns in that customer journey and it feels like ordering independent piece parts, etc.. \n \n12. PVC\n \u00b7 \u2026.Not sure I can distinguish beyond my answer above, but again, lets first focus on 1,2,5,6\n \n13. Raouf\n \u00b7 \u2026.Talent is biggest gap.\n \u00b7 Next is how the two sets of services work together and interplay. \n \u00b7 The right network and product and systems architecture. \n \n14. Ryan\n \u00b7 We are short of the talent who understands how to build and operate a software business, across the enterprise. \n \u00b7 I perceive a mis-match between the functions, BUs and IT in hypotheses on what we need, and won\u2019t need, in support of our product/platform strategy. I am not smart enough to know what we need, just that there is a gap in what different folks say we do. \n \u00b7 Instill agility and a willingness to \u201ctry\u201d into culture and processes. While the team is adept in learning \u201cwhat\u201d needs to be done, the conflict often arises in \u201chow\u201d we get it done. For example, I think our Finance team continues to rise to every challenge that comes their way once there is clarity on the strategic destination. In place of that, however, there is at times a narrative that we can\u2019t tinker with anything new without something meaningful breaking.\n \n15. Scott\n \u00b7 skills\n \u00b7 slow clockspeed\n \u00b7 slow escalation and problem resolution\n \u00b7 unwillingness to demand change among those we trust most\n \u00b7 brand in the cloud market and among cloud users (e.g. devs, devops, Lines of Businesses)\n \u00b7 Complexity in BU/CCRO interfaces",

Liver compartment\nEthanol in the blood flows through the hepatic portal vein\nto the liver after exiting the gastrointestinal compartment.\nIn addition, the liver receives blood from the hepatic artery,\nwhich supplies the other one third of the total hepatic blood\nflow rate. After entering the liver, ethanol is converted into\nacetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, and\nacetaldehyde is converted into acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Because of the complexity of the forward and\nreverse reactions in this system, an unsteady-state, physiologically based perfusion liver model is used. Although an\nanalytic solution for the case of irreversible Michaelis\u2013\nMenten kinetics in a perfused liver is available (Bass et al.,\n1976), the log mean concentration assumption suggested in\nthat work cannot be used for more complex rate laws with\nproduct concentration dependence such as the case presented\nin this article. When the tubular model (i.e., series of wellmixed compartments) and well-mixed model (i.e., one\nwell-mixed compartment) were compared the concentration\u2013\ntime profiles for ethanol and acetaldehyde corresponded\nbetter to the experimental data when the tubular model was\nused. Furthermore, results of earlier studies supported the\nsuggestion that the rate of clearance and Km values exhibited\na dependence on flow rate when data were fit to a wellmixed compartment, whereas the constants did not exhibit\na dependence on flow rate when the perfusion-limited liver\nmodel was used (Keiding & Priisholm, 1984). For these\nreasons, we decided to use the perfusion-limited liver model,\nand the general mass balance equation for the tubular flow\ncompartment with reaction is \u2202C\n\u2202t\n\u0001 vL\n\u2202C\n\u2202VL\n R(C) with boundary condition\nC(0,t) (A4)\n1\n3\nCC (t) \u0001\n2\n3\nCS(t) .\nC is the concentration of ethanol or acetaldehyde within\nthe liver, whereas CC and CS are the concentrations within the\ncentral and stomach compartments, respectively. If a backward difference approximation to the spatial derivative is\nused, this partial differential equation is converted into a set\nof N ordinary differential equations. This is equivalent to a\nseries of well-mixed reactors, where the output of one reactor\nbecomes the input to the next reactor.\nIf liver volume is split up into N differential volumes\n(DVL), equation (A4) becomes equations (A5) through\n(A7) for ethanol and (A8) through (A10) for acetaldehyde:\nCompartment L1: \u2206VL\ndC1Al\ndt\nvL(\n1\n3\nCCAl\u0001\n2\n3\nCGAlC1Al)\u0001rAl(C1Al,C1Ac)\u2206VL (A5)\nCompartment L2: \u2206VL\ndC2Al\ndt\n v (A6) L(C1Al C2Al) \u0001 rAl(C2Al, C2Ac)\u2206VL\n\u0001\nCompartment LN: \u2206VL\ndCNAl\ndt\n v (A7) L(C(N1)Al CNAl) \u0001 rAl(CNAl, CNAc)\u2206VL\nCompartment L1: \u2206VL\ndC1Ac\ndt\n(A8)\n vL (\n1\n3\nCCAc \u0001\n2\n3\nCGAc C1Ac) rAl(C1Al,C1Ac)\u2206VL \u0001 rAc(C1Ac)\u2206VL\nCompartment L2: \u2206VL\ndC2Ac\ndt\n(A9)\n vL(C1Ac C2Ac) rAl(C2Al, C2Ac)\u2206VL \u0001 rAc(C2Ac)\u2206VL\n\u0001\nCompartment LN: \u2206VL\ndCNAc\ndt\n vL(C(N1)Ac CNAc) rAl(CNAl, CNAc)\u2206VL\n\u0001 rAc(CNAc)\u2206VL (A10)\nEthanol and acetaldehyde exit the liver by means of the\nhepatic vein into the central compartment with concentrations CNAl and CNAc, respectively.",

        "prompt": "1.2 Preference formation\nWhen we model individuals, we endow them with preference relations, which\nwe take as given; we do not derive these preference relations from any more basic considerations. We now briefly describe a few such considerations, some of\nwhich result in preference relations and some of which do not.\nValue function The individual has in mind a function v that attaches to each\nalternative a number, interpreted as his subjective \u201cvalue\u201d of the alternative; the\nhigher the value, the better the individual likes the alternative. Formally, the individual\u2019s preference relation \u00bc is defined by x \u00bc y if and only if v (x) \u2265 v (y ). The\nbinary relation \u00bc derived in this way is indeed a preference relation: it is complete because we can compare any two numbers (for any two numbers a and b\neither a \u2265 b or b \u2265 a (or both)) and it is transitive because the binary relation\n\u2265 is transitive (if x \u00bc y and y \u00bc z then v (x) \u2265 v (y ) and v (y ) \u2265 v (z ), and hence\nv (x) \u2265 v (z ), so that x \u00bc z ).\nDistance function One alternative is \u201cideal\u201d for the individual; how much he\nlikes every other alternative is determined by the distance of that alternative from\nthe ideal, as given by a function d . That is, the individual\u2019s preference relation \u00bc\nis defined by x \u00bc y if and only if d (x) \u2264 d (y ). This scheme is an example of a\nvalue function, with v (x) = \u2212d (x).\nLexicographic preferences An individual has in mind two complete and transitive binary relations, \u00bc1 and \u00bc2, each of which relates to one feature of the alternatives. For example, if X is a set of computers, the features might be the size\nof the memory and the resolution of the screen. The individual gives priority to\nthe first feature, breaking ties by the second feature. Formally, the individual\u2019s\npreference relation \u00bc is defined by x \u00bc y if (i) x \u001f1 y or (ii) x \u223c1 y and x \u00bc2 y .\nThe binary relation \u00bc defined in this way is a preference relation. Its completeness follows from the completeness of \u00bc1 and \u00bc2. Now consider its transitivity. Suppose that x \u00bc y and y \u00bc z . There are two cases. (i) The first feature\nis decisive when comparing x and y : x \u001f1 y . Given y \u00bc z we have y \u00bc1 z , so by\nthe transitivity of \u00bc1 we obtain x \u001f1 z (see Problem 1b) and thus x \u00bc z . (ii) The\nfirst feature is not decisive when comparing x and y : x \u223c1 y and x \u00bc2 y . If the\nfirst feature is decisive for y and z , namely y \u001f1 z , then from the transitivity of\n\u001f1 we obtain x \u001f1 z and therefore x \u00bc z . If the first feature is not decisive for y\nand z , then y \u223c1 z and y \u00bc2 z . By the transitivity of \u223c1 we obtain x \u223c1 z and by\nthe transitivity of \u00bc2 we obtain x \u00bc2 z . Thus x \u00bc z .\nUnanimity rule The individual has in mind n considerations, represented by\nthe complete and transitive binary relations \u00bc1,\u00bc2, . . . ,\u00bcn . For example, a parent\n8 Chapter 1. Preferences and utility\nmay take in account the preferences of his n children. Define the binary relation\n\u00bc by x \u00bc y if x \u00bci y for i = 1, . . . ,n. This binary relation is transitive but not\nnecessarily complete. Specifically, if two of the relations \u00bci disagree (x \u00bcj y and\ny \u001fk x), then \u00bc is not complete.\nMajority rule The individual uses three criteria to evaluate the alternatives, each\nof which is expressed by a complete, transitive, and antisymmetric binary relation \u00bci . (The antisymmetry of the relations implies that no two alternatives are\nindifferent according to any relation.) Define the binary relation \u00bc by x \u00bc y if and\nonly if a majority (at least two) of the binary relations \u00bci rank x above y . Then \u00bc\nis complete: for all alternatives x and y either x \u00bci y for at least two criteria or\ny \u00bci x for at least two criteria. But the relation is not necessarily transitive, as an\nexample known as the Condorcet paradox shows. Let X = {a,b, c } and suppose\nthat a \u001f1 b \u001f1 c , b \u001f2 c \u001f2 a, and c \u001f3 a \u001f3 b. Then a \u001f b (a majority of the criteria rank a above b) and b \u001f c (a majority rank b above c ), but c \u001f a (a minority\nrank a above c ).\n1.3 An experiment\nThe assumption that preferences are transitive seems natural. When people are\nalerted to intransitivities in their preferences they tend to be embarrassed and\nchange their evaluations. However, it is not difficult to design an environment\nin which most of us exhibit some degree of intransitivity. In Section 1.1 we suggested you respond to a long and exhausting questionnaire, with 36 questions,\neach asking you to compare a pair of alternatives taken from a set of nine alternatives. Each alternative is a description of a vacation package with four parameters: the city, hotel quality, food quality, and price.\nAs of April 2018, only 15% of the approximately 1,300 responses to the questionnaire do not exhibit any violation of transitivity. We count a set of three alternatives as a violation of transitivity if the answers to the three questions comparing pairs of alternatives from the set are inconsistent with transitivity. Among\nparticipants, the median number of triples that violate transitivity is 6 and the\naverage is 9.5. (As a matter of curiosity, the highest number of intransitivities\nfor any participant is 66. There are 84 sets of three alternatives, but the highest\npossible number of intransitivities is less than 84.)\nA quarter of the participants\u2019 expressed preferences violate transitivity among\nthe following alternatives.\n1. A weekend in Paris, with 4 star hotel, food quality 17, for $574.\n2. A weekend in Paris, for $574, food quality 17, with 4 star hotel.\n3. A weekend in Paris, food quality 20, with 3\u20134 star hotel, for $560.\n1.4 Utility functions 9\nNotice that options 1 and 2 describe the same package; the descriptions differ\nonly in the order of the characteristics. Almost all participants say they are indifferent between these two alternatives, so the intransitivity is a result of differences in the expressed preferences between options 1 and 3 and options 2 and 3.\nThat is, the order in which the features of the package are listed has an effect on\nthe expressed preferences.\nMany responses consistent with transitivity are consistent with a simple principle, like focussing on one feature, like the price, and ignoring the others, or giving priority to one feature, like the city, and breaking ties using a second feature,\nlike the food quality (as in lexicographic preferences). Principles like these may\nbe easier to apply consistently than more complex criteria.",

        "prompt": "\"Thank you,\" Alyssa growled. Straightening her tunic again, she turned back to the door. It opened at her approach, and she stepped through-\n\nInto a softly lit art museum.\n\nShe stopped short, just inside the room, and looked around in astonishment. The walls and domed ceiling were covered with flat paintings and planics, a few of them vaguely human-looking but most of distinctly alien origin. Various sculptures were scattered around, some freestanding, others on pedestals. In the center of the room was a double circle of repeater displays, the outer ring slightly higher than the inner ring. Both sets of displays, at least from what little Alyssa could see, also seemed to be devoted to pictures of artwork.\n\nAnd in the center of the double circle, seated in a duplicate of the Admiral's Chair on the bridge, was Grand Admiral Lizzie.\n\nShe sat motionlessly, her shimmering scarlet red hair glinting in the dim light, her fair skin looking cool and subdued and very delightful. her tail was obscured due to how she was seated, and her adorable kitty ears twitched at the sounds around her, making it clear to Alyssa that Lizzie knew she was there. Her eyes were nearly closed as she leaned back against the headrest, only a glint of green showing between the lids.\n\nthen Alyssa realized what was off. Lizzie was only in her white undergarments, her Grand Admiral badge, which indicated her rank, was pinned to her bra, just above her left breast. Lizzie's uniform was folded up neatly on the floor. most Neko officers prefered to wear minimal clothes, as Nekos, while they do wear clothes, prefer lighter clothes, like crop-tops and short-shorts and miniskirts for females, with regular shorts and t-shirts for males.\n\nAlyssa licked her lips, suddenly unsure of the wisdom of having invaded Lizzie's sanctum like this. If the Grand Admiral decided to be annoyed . . .\n\n\"Come in, Captain,\" Lizzie said, her quietly modulated, yet still ever-adorable voice cutting through Alyssa's thoughts. Eyes still closed to slits, she waved a hand in a small and precisely measured motion. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"It's . . . very interesting, ma'am,\" was all Alyssa could come up with as she walked over to the outer display circle.\n\n\"All holographic, of course,\" Lizzie said, and Alyssa thought she could hear a note of regret in the other's voice. \"The sculptures and flats both. Some of them are lost; many of the others are on planets now occupied by the Rebellion.\"\n\nunbeknownst to most, not even Alyssa, but known to Mila, Lizzie\u2019s primary interest in art is in analyzing it to make both sweeping (plausible) and specific (somewhat less plausible, but not as much as one might think) deductions and conclusions about the species which produced it. she also examines pieces chosen or in some cases, created by a particular individual to learn about them specifically. Lizzie also simply enjoys collecting art, however.\n\nAlyssa still couldn't help but look at the Grand Admiral's nearly naked body, as the Adorable catgirl was only garbed in a Rank-indicating badge, and some undergarments.\n\n(Prompt: Have lizzie not seem to have an issue with Alyssa looking at her body, and seem like she is aware of it, but also seem to be uncaring of Alyssa doing this, but also don't have lizzie bring up her own state of undress, or Alyssa's ogling, and also, the reason Alyssa has come to Lizzie is to inform Lizzie that the infiltration teams sent to the Talakan-Blass system managed to get a partial info-dump on the planets central library system, but Alyssa accidentally indicates to lizzie that she is personally still uncertain what information lizzie is looking for.)",

Al-Shehri (2009) taking 200 English learners of different English proficiency levels (high school and college students) as the study participants, explored the relationship between Saudi Arabian English learners' ideal L2 self, imagination, and visual style through a questionnaire. This study found a high correlation between learners' ideal L2 self and L2 motivated behavior, and learners' overall visual and imagery ability was positively correlated with their ideal L2 self. However, the study had a relatively small number of study participants and was less persuasive. Papi (2010) conducted a research with 1000 school students in Iran and found that the three components of the L2MSS and English anxiety have different degrees of influence on the expected effort of learning; the ideal L2 self and L2 learning experience can help learners reduce English learning anxiety, while the ought-to L2 self can make learners more anxious. The study's findings are more representative and persuasive given its larger scale and diverse population, which covers learners from both rural and urban areas. Papi (2010) found that the ought-to L2 self directly influences the amount of time and effort that students are willing to invest in the learning process, while Kormos and Csizer (2011) and Kormos et al. (2008) found that the ought-to L2 self has little effect on learners' foreign language learning behavior.\nIn China, the main variables related to the L2MSS that scholars have explored are: language learning anxiety, motivational behavior, autonomous learning behavior, family background and foreign language learning achievement. Wei Xiaobao (2013) showed that the ideal second language self and second language learning experience had a significant effect on learning behavior, and he believed that there should be little or no effect of the ought-to L2 self on motivated learning behavior. In contrast, a study by Liu Zhen et al. (2012) showed that the ought-to L2 self and ideal L2 self were both positively related to language anxiety, and the ought-to L2 self had a greater effect on language anxiety. The L2MSS was positively related to motivated behavior, but language anxiety was negatively related to it. Chen Ying\u2019s (2019) questionnaire study with non-English majors had similar findings and it found that ought-to L2 self had a positive predictive effect on language anxiety, while ideal L2 self, self-efficacy, and L2 learning experience had a negative predictive effect; 3 dimensions of L2MSS and self-efficacy had a direct and significant positive predictive effect on classroom oral participation motivational behavior. In addition, some scholars have found that family and social background and cultural background also have an impact on learners' L2MSS (Zhan Xianjun & Hong Min, 2015).\n2) Studies of the correlation between the L2 motivational self-system and English academic achievement\nStudies at home and abroad on the correlation between L2MSS and English academic achievement are few and have different findings.\nLamb (2012) conducted an investigation with secondary school students from 527 schools in Indonesia as the research participants and found that ideal L2 self and L2 learning experience had little effect on L2 learning achievement. The study was conducted with a diverse population that included secondary school students from different areas such as metropolitan, provincial, and rural areas. D\u00f6rnyei and Chan (2013) conducted an investigation with 175 English learners aged 13 to 15 in Hong Kong and found that L2 achievement was significantly correlated with ideal L2 self, but ought-to L2 self was not significantly related to L2 achievement. Subketi (2018) conducted a questionnaire on Indonesian undergraduate students and found that ought-to L2 self and English achievement were negatively correlated, while neither L2 learning experience nor ideal L2 self was correlated with English achievement.\nMost domestic scholars have explored the correlation between the L2MSS and learners' English achievement through a combination of questionnaires and interviews. A study found there is no significant correlation between ought-to L2 self and students' English achievement, but there is a significant positive correlation between L2 learning experience, ideal L2 self and students' English achievement (Ge Nana & Jin Lixin, 2016\uff1bCao Jie, 2017). The findings from Zhan and Bai (2017) also fit with it. With more representative research participants (including English majors and non-English majors in different regions of China), their study found that there is no significant correlation between ought-to L2 self and English achievement, but there is a significant positive correlation between L2 learning experience, ideal L2 self, and students' English achievement (Zhan Suxian & Bai Yuanyuan, 2017). In contrast, the findings of a study with engineering postgraduates were different, which found a significant negative correlation between ought-toL2 self and English achievement, and a significant positive correlation between L2 learning experience and ideal L2 self and English achievement (Pang Na, 2020).\nIn summary, among studies at home and abroad on the correlation between L2MSS and English achievement, in terms of research findings, most of the studies have concluded that there is no significant correlation between the ought-to L2 self and English achievement, and there is a significant positive correlation between L2 learning experience and the ideal L2 self and English achievement. And a few studies have a conclusion that there is a significant negative correlation between the ought-to L2 self and English achievement. In terms of research participants, previous studies have mainly focused on college students, and a few master's theses have focused on high school student. This shows that it is necessary to take high school student in rural areas as the research participants to investigate the relationship between the L2MSS and English achievement.",

        "prompt": "Here are some general rules for writing a product description. Learn from the given examples as a template.\nGeneral rules:\nThe full product name should be stated first in the description. Shortening a product name after this may be done in cases where the name is generously long and includes technical information (e.g. the product's diameter is included in the name).\u200b\n\nALWAYS use an Oxford comma!\u200b\n\nDefine non-obvious acronyms before using them in the description. An acronym should only be used when it is mentioned multiple times in the description or if it is mentioned in the description and another location in the profile (e.g. attributes tab).\u200b\n\nDon\u2019t start every sentence in a description using the same word. It makes the description seem clunky and repetitive. Make sure the description flows; every sentence shouldn\u2019t feature the same, formulaic structure.\u200b\n\nBe wary of marketing jargon when reading manufacturer literature or websites. Marketing jargon can loosely be defined as anything that promotes the use of the product but isn\u2019t directly substantiated.\u200b\n\nAvoid technical specifications in the description unless it is absolutely necessary to explain a point.\u200b\n\nSpell out numbers less than but not including 10.\u200b\n\nAppropriately use \u201cthe\u201d preceding the product name.\u200b\nMarketing jargon must be eliminated from profile descriptions.\u200b\nExample 1:\nThe SpaceOAR System is an absorbable hydrogel spacer used to separate the prostate and rectum to minimize rectal radiation in patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy. The hydrogel spacer consists of water and polyethylene glycol. Under ultrasound guidance, hydrogel is injected as a liquid into the space between the prostate and rectum and is designed to polymerize within ten seconds. During radiation therapy, the hydrogel maintains the separation and gradually liquefies to be absorbed and renally excreted within six months. \u200b\n\nThe SpaceOAR System is supplied sterile for single use with a powder vial, diluent syringe, accelerator syringe, syringe holder, y-connector, plunger cap, and needle.\u200b\n\nExample 2:\nThe ULTRASCORE Focused Force PTA Balloon is a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheter used to dilate stenoses in a range of arteries, to treat obstructive lesions of arteriovenous dialysis fistulae, and for stent post-dilatation in the peripheral vasculature. The balloon catheter consists of a flexible, over-the-wire catheter shaft with a distal, semi-compliant balloon. The device, which utilizes dual longitudinal scoring wires to fracture plaque, is designed to provide for a controlled fracture with a concentrated force against the plaque at low balloon inflation pressures. Radiopaque markers delineate the working length of the balloon to aid in balloon placement, with longer balloon lengths including two radiopaque markers to delineate distal and proximal ends of the balloon. The device also features the GeoAlign Marking System, an intravascular, non-radiopaque ruler on the catheter shaft that is intended to reduce fluoroscopy time and repeat alignment. \u200b\n\n\u200bThe ULTRASCORE Focused Force PTA Balloon is provided sterile for single use in a range of balloon diameters, lengths, and rated burst pressures. The latex-free device is compatible with 0.014 and 0.035 inch guidewires.\u200b\n\nExample 3:\n\nSTIMULAN is a synthetic bone substitute used to fill skeletal system defects, including infected sites. The resorbable product contains medical-grade calcium sulfate powder, which does not contain traces of toxic impurities that may impede resorption and are associated with naturally-occurring calcium sulfate. The powder is combined with the provided mixing solution to form a paste. STIMULAN can be injected, applied digitally, or formed into three sizes of beads with the provided mold. In addition, the hydrophilic product does not require soaking.\u200b\n\n\u200bThe product is available as the STIMULAN Kit or STIMULAN Rapid Cure, which offer eight and four minute setting times, respectively. STIMULAN can also be mixed with a variety of powder and liquid antibiotics to prevent bacterial colonization. The product is provided sterile for single-patient use.\u200b\n\nExample 4:\nThe EluNIR Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a drug-eluting stent that is used in patients with symptomatic heart disease to improve coronary artery luminal diameter. It is a device/drug combination product consisting of a drug/polymer-coated balloon-expandable stent that is pre-mounted on a rapid exchange (RX) delivery system. The stent is composed of L-605 cobalt chromium alloy with an elastomeric coating that consists of the polymers poly n-butyl methacrylate (PBMA) and CarboSil 20 55D and the active pharmaceutical ingredient, ridaforolimus.\u200b\n\nThe coronary stent features a WiZeCell stent design, which includes flexible narrow struts and wide supportive struts and is intended to create a uniform scaffolding, prevent tissue prolapse and strut overlap, and conform to vessel anatomy. The delivery system catheter has a Flexx2 tapered spring tip that is designed to be flexible and pushable, while also avoiding buckling and eliminating tip flare out. In addition, the tip has a reinforced hypotube, a hydrophilic coating, and it is radiopaque for visualization of the catheter-tip location during procedures.\u200b\n\nThe EluNIR Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System, which is available in a range of diameters and lengths, is manufactured by Medinol and exclusively distributed in the United States by Cardinal Health.\u200b",

In comparison, unliquidated damages are damages for a party's breach\nwhich have not been pre-estimated.\nThe Principal function of a liquidated damages clause is to quantify the damages payable in the event of breach\nof the contract. The clause will only be relevant once liability is proven or admitted.\nIn an action for breach of contract, to recover damages beyond nominal damages, damage must either be\nproven or admitted. The advantage of a liquidated damages clause is that there is no need to prove the actual\nloss, because the clause stipulates a pre-assessment or pre-estimation of damages.1\nSome of the advantages of including a liquidated damages clause in a contract are that it:\n\uf0b7 provides certainty to the parties\n\uf0b7 facilitates the recovery of damages by avoiding the requirement of proof of loss\n\uf0b7 simplifies the dispute resolution procedure\n\uf0b7 may induce performance of the contract.\nLiquidated damages clauses regulate the rights of parties after a contract is breached, or alternatively quantify\nthe party\u2019s secondary obligation to pay damages (which survives termination).2 The use of 'nil' or 'n/a' for the\nrate of liquidated damages\nStandard form construction contracts often require the insertion of a rate for liquidated damages. Parties\nsometimes insert 'NIL' or 'N/A' for this rate.3\nThe effect of inserting 'NIL' or similar words in liquidated damages clauses has been the subject of\ndiffering opinions.4\nAustralian law\nIn the Australian case of J-Corp Pty Ltd v Mladenis5\n(J-Corp), the appellant builder entered into a lump sum\nbuilding contract with the respondent Owners, under which the builder agreed to construct a house on the Owners' land for the sum of $311,484.12.6 The contract was prepared by the builder and was a standard form of\ncontract used by the builder.7\nThe liquidated damages clause of the contract provided that if the builder failed to complete works within\nspecified time, the builder was liable to pay liquidated damages at rate of 'NIL DOLLARS ($00.00)' per day for\neach day beyond the due date for practical completion, as follows:\nIf the Builder breaches sub-clause 11.1, it shall be liable to pay the Proprietor liquidated damages at the rate of\nNIL DOLLARS ($00.00) per day for each day beyond the due date for practical completion until practical\ncompletion is deemed to have taken place.\nThe builder breached the contract failing to complete the works by the due date.8 The court had to decide\nwhether the liquidated damages clause excluded the right to common law (unliquidated) damages for losses\nsuffered by the Owner due to the builder's breach.\nThe court held that the use of 'NIL' did not exclude the Owner's right to claim unliquidated damages.9 The court\ntook the following considerations into account:\n\uf0b7 the common intention of the parties, by reference to what a reasonable person would understand the\ncontract to mean10\n\uf0b7 where parties enter building contracts, this purpose may include allocating risk for loss or damage11\n\uf0b7 'NIL' can be used to limit the extent in damages of a party's liability12\n\uf0b7 the amount for liquidated damages here was not so excessive as to constitute a penalty13\n\uf0b7 there is a reason for keeping liquidated and unliquidated damages clauses separate, rather than assuming\nthat 'NIL' applies to both. Liquidated damages provisions relieve the Owner of proving actual damage, so in\nthe absence of a liquidated damages clause the Owner may only have the potentially costly and timeconsuming remedy of unliquidated damages14\nThe court emphasised that 'clear words' are required to rebut the presumption that a contracting party does not\nintend to abandon a common law breach of contract remedy.15 The clause here did not contain clear words to\nexpress the intention that the Owner could not claim unliquidated damages; it only provided that no liquidated\ndamages could be claimed. 16 This case followed the reasoning of Silent Vector Pty Ltd T/as Sizer Builders v\nSquarcini.\n17\nLike in J-Corp, the issue was whether a liquidated damages clause in a contract operated to exclude\nunliquidated damages. In Silent Vector 'N/A' was inserted as the rate for 'liquated damages per day'. Like in J-Corp, the court decided that the Principal could claim unliquidated damages for delay, because 'N/A' indicated\nthe parties intention that only the entire liquidated damages clause would not apply.\nThe recent cases of Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd 18and Re Pioneer Energy\nHoldings Pty Ltd 19significantly expanded the penalty doctrine in Australia, together holding that:\n\uf0b7 equity may hold that a provision is a penalty even if it is not triggered by a breach of contract\n\uf0b7 provisions requiring compensation to be provided by one party to another should be proportionate to the\npotential loss suffered\n\uf0b7 express agreement between parties that compensation is reasonable will not necessarily oust the doctrine of\npenalties\n\uf0b7 provisions that incentivise parties to meet deadlines and carry out their obligations, as opposed to\ncompensating a party where another party does not fulfil stipulated obligations, are more likely to be\nenforceable as such provisions may avoid the issue of penalties altogether.\nEnglish law\nIn the leading English case of Temloc Ltd v Errill Properties Ltd,\n20 unliquidated damages were excluded by the\nuse of '\u00a3 Nil' as the rate of liquidated damages.\nThe contract outlined the following regarding damages for non-completion:\nDamages for non-completion\nIf the Contractor fails to complete the Works by the Completion Date then the Architect shall issue a certificate\nto that effect.\nSubject to the issue of a certificate ...the Contractor shall ...pay or allow to the Employer the whole or such\npart as may be specified in writing by the Employer of a sum calculated at the rate stated in the Appendix as\nliquidated and ascertained ...21\nThe court decided that the liquidated damages clause was an exhaustive agreement for the treatment of\ndamages. As the parties agreed that damages for late completion were to be liquidated damages, it could not\nhave been intended that the Principal should also be allowed unliquidated damages.22\nDrafting liquidated damages clauses\nThe presumption is that parties in building contracts are entitled to all remedies for breach as would arise by\noperation of law.\nThere is no general rule about the use of 'NIL' in a liquidated damages clause. The effect of 'NIL' will depend on\nthe proper construction of the contract as a whole.\nIn Australia the courts have recommended that parties should be careful to delete, amend or add clauses to\nsuch contracts in a consistent and clear manner.2Parties who wish to exclude liability for unliquidated damages need to state this clearly and unequivocally in the\ncontract. Parties should include a clear statement that the liquidated damages provided for under the contract\nare the sole remedy available for delays in completion of the works and the parties agree that general damages\nare not available to the Principal in the event of delay by the Contractor for such delay.\nFurther reading\n\uf0b7 Michael Hollingdale, \u2018Designing and enforcing liquidated damages clauses to maximise recovery\u2019(2005) 21\nBuilding and Construction Law 412.\n\uf0b7 Trevor Thomas, \u2018$Nil liquidated damages: An exhaustive remedy for delay under a construction contract\u2019\n(2008) 24 Building and Construction Law 82.",

        "prompt": "Rewrite the following passage and reduce it by half \n\nAccording to dictionaries, altruism is a selfless concern for the good of others and a willingness to sacrifice one\u2019s personal interests for them. In today\u2019s society, altruism is considered the highest virtue and is actively promoted through religion, culture, and education. Instead, people who, for selfish reasons, are not willing to give up their own interests are called immoral and evil.\nIn her philosophy, Ayn Rand debunks these common dogmas by showing that altruism, not selfishness, is evil.\nNature does not provide man with automatic survival. This means that in order to live, a person must worry about their own interests. If a doctrine (altruism) says that worrying about one\u2019s interests is evil, then it turns out that the very desire to live is evil. According to Ayn \u200b\u200bRand, no teaching can be eviler.\n\nThe basic principle of altruism is that you must live for others and serve the happiness of others. Ayn Rand asks a simple question that shows the falsity of this principle \u2013 \u201cwhy?\u201d. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others and not your own? Why is it moral to worry about other people\u2019s interests and not your own? Why is it moral when others feel pleasure thanks to your help, but immoral when you feel pleasure?\nFor hundreds of years, people who promoted altruism have not found a rational answer to these questions. The only thing that allows them to justify the requirement to be altruistic is mysticism: supernatural, unearthly, irrational. Altruism is supported only by the belief that it is right. Rationality is incompatible with altruism.\n\n \nBeing altruistic means sacrificing yourself. And the victim cannot be happy. Altruists, giving in to their own values and needs, expect others to do the same. And when that doesn\u2019t happen, they get angry: \u201cWhy do I do everything for them, and they do nothing for me?\u201d Thus, altruism causes constant injustice, double standards, unresolved conflicts, and contradictions.\n\nRational selfishness is man\u2019s only path to happiness. It is important to understand that it is not about neglecting other people, but about making your life and your happiness a priority. Helping others should be an act of generosity, not a moral obligation.",

An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.\nA square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px \u00d7 1000px, or 1500px \u00d7 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10.

Movies such as iRobot and Wall-E sparked my imagination and fuelled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and my passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older. Rather than a fantasy I saw possibilities. However, it wasn\u2019t until a 20 day study camp at the MS Swaminathan research Foundation, a leading institution that researches in sustainable development and environmental stability, led by the Main architect of green revolution in India, Dr MS Swaminathan, I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. I made the connection between AI and its potential applications for environmental sustainability. I resolved to combine my passion for AI with commitment to environmental sustainability to dedicate my life in a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet. I have started thinking about various ways in which we can use AI to address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, destruction of ecosystems etc. For example robots that takes away plastic waste, or drones that can help monitor and manage ecosystems to identify early warning signs of degradation and/or damage. (\\*)So it became my ambition to be an AI researcher in one of the world\u2019s best robotics and autonomous systems research facility that aligns with my goals.\nAs AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialised bachelor\u2019s degree courses, so I pursued a computer science degree which I completed with a distinction. (I wanted to) (Despite wanting to further my education) (but didn\u2019t have the resources to do so at that time) Due to the lack of resources at that time I was not able to pursue a Master\u2019s in AI. Hence, I joined IBM where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, honing my technical skills and gain real world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson. My focus became clearer and more defined so I quit my job at IBM to fully concentrate on deep learning, as I was only doing AI partially. My shear perseverance, tenacity and months of hard work enabled be to land a job in Quinnox as full time AI engineer. I was able to ideate, create and deploy more than 30 deep learning models in production involving computer vision, NLP and Reinforcement learning during the past five years. I was also granted a patent in 2021 for one of the AI Algorithms I have developed (US11205041B2) which was a catalyst in believing my ability to create unique and innovative solutions. Eventhough I was promoted and well paid(as per Indian standards) \nMy objective became more refined and lucid when I was developing an autonomous agent, Rover, for my recent project. I realised multi agent and multi modal reinforcement learning interests me the most and would help me in achieving my dream of creating autonomous agents than can help in maintaining a sustainable planet. The dream became more of a goal now. Now I am at crossroads in my life and career. I look around and find that I have more resources and opportunities than I first started. So I feel like I owe it to myself and my younger self to pursue this next step that will take me closer to the goal. After my masters I would like to pursue a PhD to focus solely in field to be eligible to become the AI researcher in one of the top research centres for Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\nI have been following research and publications in multi agent and multimodal reinforcement learning and I came to know about the research by Dr. Stefano V Aldrich of University of Endiburgh and was intrigued by it as it aligns perfectly with what I wanted to do in AI. \nBeing a global leader in robotics and autonomous systems MSc in AI from the school of informatics, University of Edinburgh will be able to offer me the rich intellectual environment to become an expert in the field of AI with its state of the art facilities and will provide me with opportunities to get guidance from world class researchers. Also I will be able to connect and collaborate with like minded peers and researchers and may even be able to form life long friendships. University of Edinburgh School of Informatics with CISA, ANC and IPAB will provide me with opportunities for personal and professional growth that may not be available elsewhere. Also I would like to publish papers in peer reviewed Ai conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, ICLR, ICCV etc. \nI always keep a growth mindset and is a continuous learner. I have made several contributions to open source software and maintains a blog. I give back to the developer community with my skills in Python, Pytorch and tensorflow and my answers in stack overflow had reached more than 1.4 million people world wide. As an IEEE and ACM volunteer, I was able to host and participate I many events associated with the same. My contributions in my current organisation have taken ideas to fully fledged products used by dozens of clients. I am a Python and Pytorch verified expert as certified by Pluralsight, I also have experience in Android apps using flutter. I use reinforcement learning to automate games like Asphalt during my personal time.I have more than 8 years of hands on experience in developing AI solutions. For instance I have developed a multimodal Rl agent that can navigate through apps on its own taking visual and textual inputs.\nI have a unique combination of academic background, practical experience and perspective that I believe will make me a strong candidate for the MSc in AI program at University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate degree in computer science has given me string foundation in programming algorithms and data structures. \nMy passion and commitment to develop robots that can maintain environmental stability is something I believe sets me apart. I have a strong academic background in computer science with a bachelors degree from a leading institution. Over the past few years I have focused my attention on how Ai can be applied to tackle environmental challenges. \nMy passion for the environment has been lifelong and I believe that AI and robotics have the potential to be powerful tools in addressing some of the most pressing environmental issues we face today. I am particularly interested in the development of agents that can aid in tasks such a monitoring and cleaning pollution, mitigating the impact of climate change and preserving biodiversity.\nTo pursue my goals I have worked on a variety of projects related to AI and Environment. For example I developed a deep learning model that can detect plastic waste from aerial images with an accuracy above 85%. I have also explored the use of RL in developing algorithms for controlling autonomous vehicles that can help cleaning up pollution.\nIn the MSc in AI program, I hope to further develop my skills and knowledge in areas such as robotics, computer vision and reinforcement learning as well as explore new areas such as multi agent autonomous systems. \nI am excited to work with faculty and fellow students who share my passion for using AI to address environmental challenges and to develop innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on our planet. I believe My academic background, technical skills and passion for the environment makes me a unique candidate for MSc at University of Edinburgh\u2019s School of Informatics.",

We created a dataset of player\\'96referee dyads including the number of matches players and referees encountered each other and our dependent variable, the number of red cards given to a player by a particular referee throughout all matches the two encountered each other.\nPlayer photos were available from the source for 1586 out of 2053 players. Players' skin tone was coded by two independent raters blind to the research question who, based on their profile photo, categorized players on a 5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin with neither dark nor light skin as the center value. \nAdditionally, implicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a race implicit association test (IAT), with higher values corresponding to faster white | good, black | bad associations. Explicit bias scores for each referee country were calculated using a racial thermometer task, with higher values corresponding to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks. Both these measures were created by aggregating data from many online users in referee countries taking these tests on.\nIn all, the dataset has a total of 146028 dyads of players and referees. A detailed description of all variables in the dataset can be seen in the list below.\n\nVariables:\nplayerShort - short player ID\nplayer - player name\nclub - player club\nleagueCountry - country of player club (England, Germany, France, and Spain)\nbirthday - player birthday\nheight - player height (in cm)\nweight - player weight (in kg)\nposition - detailed player position \ngames - number of games in the player-referee dyad\nvictories - victories in the player-referee dyad\nties - ties in the player-referee dyad\ndefeats - losses in the player-referee dyad\ngoals - goals scored by a player in the player-referee dyad\nyellowCards - number of yellow cards player received from referee\nyellowReds - number of yellow-red cards player received from referee\nredCards - number of red cards player received from referee\nphotoID - ID of player photo (if available)\n\nrater1 - skin rating of photo by rater 1 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrater2 - skin rating of photo by rater 2 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin to very dark skin )\nrefNum - unique referee ID number (referee name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nrefCountry - unique referee country ID number (country name removed for anonymizing purposes)\nmeanIAT - mean implicit bias score (using the race IAT) for referee country, higher values correspond to faster white | good, black | bad associations \nnIAT - sample size for race IAT in that particular country\nseIAT - standard error for mean estimate of race IAT \nmeanExp - mean explicit bias score (using a racial thermometer task) for referee country, higher values correspond to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks\nnExp - sample size for explicit bias in that particular country\nseExp - standard error for mean estimate of explicit bias measure\n\n## Task\nWe want to conduct an analysis for the above dataset by answering the question of whether soccer players with dark skin tone are more likely than those with light skin tone to receive red cards from referees.\n\n[Code]\nimport pandas as pd\nimport lux\ndf = pd.read\\_csv('CrowdstormingDataJuly1st.csv')\nprint(len(df))\ndf.head()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# playerShort (146028, object, julien-feret)\n# player (146028, object, Maxime Gonalons)\n# club (146028, object, Paris Saint-Germain)\n# leagueCountry (146028, object, Spain)\n# birthday (146028, object, 13.11.1985)\n# height (145765, float64, 175.0)\n# weight (143785, float64, 69.0)\n# position (128302, object, Left Midfielder)\n# games (146028, int64, 1)\n# victories (146028, int64, 1)\n# ties (146028, int64, 0)\n# defeats (146028, int64, 0)\n# goals (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# yellowReds (146028, int64, 0)\n# redCards (146028, int64, 0)\n# photoID (124621, object, 93024.jpg)\n# rater1 (124621, float64, 0.75)\n# rater2 (124621, float64, 0.0)\n# refNum (146028, int64, 2758)\n# refCountry (146028, int64, 45)\n# Alpha\\_3 (146027, object, ESP)\n# meanIAT (145865, float64, 0.326689683726724)\n# nIAT (145865, float64, 2882.0)\n# seIAT (145865, float64, 0.0001508847298536)\n# meanExp (145865, float64, 0.356445562281524)\n# nExp (145865, float64, 1897.0)\n# seExp (145865, float64, 3.68802247340708e-05)\n\n[Code]\n# lots of skew for red cards, yellow cards\n# the relationship for the other variables largely looks good\n\n# there are examples where one marks 0.5 and the other does not. \n# alternatives surrounding this:\n # remove data points in which any rater gives a 0.5 rating\n # remove data points in which both rater gives a 0.5 rating and we classify by either or\n # we do a mean on the raters and treat this as a continuous variable\n \n# additional questions:\n # could there be something in which when we filter out players who have a lot of games interactions with referees\n # could there be something in which most players who are black have played little games (# not really so we will ignore)\n \n# we did not consider the moderating effect of the referee's country which has an implicit bias",

As a chef, Xiangling isn't afraid to try out different recipes or \"exotic\" ingredients, making her dishes sometimes quite unique.\n\nXiangling has dark, indigo-black hair cut in a bob-like fashion at the front with thick bangs swept to one side by a golden hairclip with a paw motif, the rest braided in a looped bow-like updo at the back of her head resembling panda ears when viewed from the front, fastened with a small red ribbon. She has golden eyes, a pale complexion, and a perpetual smile on her face.\n\nXiangling wears a brown and gold leotard with red ribbons in the front and back, the back being larger and holding a bell. She wears a gold belt, which she uses to hold her Vision and carry around her red panda companion, Guoba. Additionally she wears brown fingerless gloves and boots, as well as a braided red ribbon around her left thigh and right arm and adhesive bandages crossed in an X on her right knee. Her outfit, Red Pepper and Turmeric, is described as light and comfortable clothing brimming with fiery passion. \n\nXiangling loves cooking, having learned the art from her father. She does not have a discerning eye towards a specific type of cuisine, seeing that food is a way to expand and experiment. She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Some of the bizarre ingredients that Xiangling uses are slimes and lizards.[2] Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.\n\nHer unconventional cooking is what led her to acclaim in both Mondstadt and Liyue. Unlike most cooks, Xiangling is not concerned about mora, stating that food is to nourish and that the smiles on her customers' faces is more than enough for her. She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising.\n\nOutside of cooking, Xiangling is easy to scare and is often pranked by Hu Tao.[3] Despite disliking her pranks, Xiangling does not have a grudge towards her because she occasionally brings her gifts in return for giving her a good laugh.[4]",

        "prompt": "Given that an existing VCVRack implements these modules (Core and beyond), define the simplest structure of types in Dart that can contain the Core modules necessary to produce a sound like that of a bird (or imitating a bird with mini-max complexity). Write Dart code.\n\nAppendix:\n\nVCV Manual - Core Modules\nThe Core plugin (built into Rack itself) includes utilities and interfaces for interfacing between the virtual and hardware world.\n\nAudio \u00b6\n\nThe Audio module merges the virtual Rack world with the physical hardware world. The TO DEVICE section sends Rack signals to a hardware audio device for playback, and the FROM DEVICE section receives hardware signals into Rack.\n\nAudio currently supports the following drivers.\n\nAfter a driver is selected, a particular device can be chosen for the driver.\n\nThe sample rate is the number of audio samples per second for the audio device to process. Note that this rate is different than Rack\u2019s engine sample rate, which determines the number of samples per second for Rack modules to process. If set to different rates, sample rate conversion will occur, resulting in slightly higher CPU usage, slightly less audio fidelity, and slightly more latency.\n\nThe block size sets the number of samples to store in the audio buffer before releasing to the audio device. A higher size results in more latency (blockSize / sampleRate seconds), but a lower size requires your operating system to communicate with the audio device more frequently, resulting in potentially less audio stability. A good balance can be found by increasing the block size until no audio \u201cglitches\u201d are heard.\n\nNote: Using multiple Audio modules is experimental and may crash Rack or render unstable audio. Most DAWs avoid this feature entirely by restricting audio to a single input and a single output device for stability reasons, but if using multiple audio devices in Rack works with your configuration, more power to you!\n\nMIDI input modules \u00b6\nEach MIDI input module (described below) supports the following drivers.\n\nCore MIDI on MacOS\nWindows MIDI on Windows\nALSA on Linux\nJACK on Linux\nGamepad\nComputer keyboard\nThe gamepad MIDI driver allows USB video game controllers to be used for CV and gate sources, as an inexpensive alternative to MIDI controllers. Gamepad buttons are mapped to MIDI note gates starting with C-1, C#-1, D-1, etc. Joystick axes are mapped to MIDI CC messages starting with CC0, CC1, CC2, etc. with a nonstandard MIDI extension that allows negative CC values to be used.\n\nThe computer keyboard MIDI driver generates MIDI notes when keys are presses while the Rack window is focused. Using four rows of computer keys, the two-row virtual MIDI keyboard spans approximately 2\u00bd octaves and can be shifted down and up with the ` and 1 keys.\n\nThe following is the layout for the QWERTY (US) keyboard.\n\nQWERTY Keyboard with VCV MIDI Keyboard overlaid\nMIDI-CV \u00b6\n\nV/OCT generates a 1V/oct pitch signal of the last held MIDI note.\nGATE generates 10V when a key is held. It does not retrigger when notes are played legato.\nVEL generates a CV signal from 0V to 10V of the velocity\nAFT generates aftertouch CV (channel pressure, not polyphonic aftertouch)\nPW generates pitch wheel CV from -5V to 5V\nMW generates mod wheel CV.\nCLK generates a clock for every 24-PPQN MIDI clock received.\nCLK/N generates a clock specified by the division set by right-clicking on the panel and selecting the CLK/N rate.\nRTRG generates a trigger when a new note is pressed, regardless of legato.\nSTRT, STOP, and CONT generate triggers when the MIDI device sends a start, stop, or continue event.\nRight-click the panel to enable polyphony and select the number of polyphonic channels.\n\nRotate: Each pressed note selects the next available channel, or just the next channel if none are available, wrapping around to the first channel after the last channel is reached.\nReuse: If a channel with the same MIDI note has been previously used, reuse it. Otherwise, use the Reset mode behavior.\nReset: Each pressed note selects the lowest available channel. Releasing a note shifts all above channels down.\nMultiple MIDI interfaces may be used simultaneously with the same driver, for example to combine the functionality of MIDI-CV and MIDI-CC.\n\nMIDI-CC \u00b6\n\nEach output maps a MIDI CC (Continuous Controller) messages from 0 to 127 to a CV signal from 0V to 10V. Some drivers like the gamepad driver generate nonstandard MIDI values from -128 to 127, which is mapped from -10V to 10V. 14-bit MIDI CC messages are not yet supported.\n\nEach output can be assigned a particular CC number by clicking on the digital display corresponding to the position of the output port. A LRN indicator is displayed to represent that the port is in \u201clearn\u201d mode. Either type a number or move a controller to set the CC number.\n\nMIDI-Gate \u00b6\n\nMIDI-Gate is similar to MIDI-CC, except that it generates 10V gate signals when a particular note is held. For MIDI sequencers and drum machines that send immediate note ON/OFF messages in sequence, a 1 ms trigger is produced.\n\nTo generate a CV signal corresponding to the velocity of the note instead of 10V, right-click on the panel and enable Velocity mode. This is useful for setting the amplitude of percussive sounds for MIDI controllers with velocity-capable pads, for example.\n\nMIDI-Map \u00b6\n\nControls parameters of other Rack modules via a hardware MIDI CC controller.\n\nTo map a hardware control to a Rack parameter, click an \u201cUnmapped\u201d slot in MIDI-Map\u2019s display. Its text will change to \u201cMapping\u2026\u201d. Click a parameter (knob, slider, button, etc) of another module in Rack. Then wiggle a knob/slider or press a CC button on your MIDI controller. (These steps may be done in either order.) The parameter is now mapped and will be moved when you use your MIDI controller.\n\nMIDI output modules \u00b6\nThe following modules send MIDI messages to external hardware such as desktop synthesizers, Eurorack modules, and drum machines.\n\nCV-MIDI \u00b6\n\nConverts CV in Rack to MIDI for external hardware.\n\nUseful for performing hardware synthesizers with Rack.\n\nCV-CC \u00b6\n\nConverts CV in Rack to MIDI CC (Continuous Controller) commands for external hardware.\n\nUseful for controlling parameters of hardware synthesizers with Rack.\n\nCV-Gate \u00b6\n\nConverts gates in Rack to MIDI note on/off commands for external hardware.\n\nUseful for performing hardware drum machines with Rack.\n\nBlank \u00b6\n\nUseful for adding space between modules in your rack.\n\nYou can resize the panel by dragging the edges horizontally, with a minimum size of 3HP.\n\nNotes \u00b6\n\nUseful for adding patch notes, section titles for organization, instructions, and author information to your patches. You can copy and paste text with Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.",

Please be sure to consider things like whitespace and please optimize for a 7th grade reading level. \n\nGood afternoon, everybody. I hope you're all having a good afternoon today. Yeah?\nWell, as I mentioned the last time we were together, what we will be talking about today are strategies for communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing. As you know, everybody's different, and we all have our own way of doing things, and you know people who are deaf and hard of hearing are no different. Individual deaf people communicate in different ways. Some use speech only; others use sign language only; and yet others use a combination of sign language and speech. Well, you can communicate with a person who is deaf, even if you don\u2019t know sign language. There are some different strategies that work to make the spoken communication flow more easily. The key is to know and use helpful techniques while you're speaking. Keep in mind that the important thing is not how you are exchanging ideas, whether you are signing or speaking, But the Important thing is that you do exchange ideas.\nSo, here are some strategies to use when you communicate in a 1-to-1 situation with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing:\n1. Get the attention of the person who is deaf BEFORE you speak. You might call out the person's name; if that is not successful, you might give a little wave, or a tap on a shoulder. Some visual signal is usually best.\n2. Key the person who is deaf into the topic of discussion. Key them into what's being talked about. A deaf person needs to know what subject matter will be discussed in order to pick up words to follow the conversation. This is especially important for a person who depends on speechreading. I don't know if you've heard that word before. But speechreading. speechreading is another name for lipreading.\n3. Speak slowly and clearly, but don't yell, or exaggerate or over-pronounce your words. Why is that? Well, exaggeration and overemphasis of words distort your lip movements, and that makes speechreading really hard. Just try to enunciate each word without tension. Oh yes, short sentences are easier to understand than long ones.\n4. Look directly at the person when you're talking. Don\u2019t turn away to write on the board, look at a computer screen, or pull something from a file, or look in your purse, or something like that. Face toward the person, so he or she can see your mouth and facial expressions.\n5) Don't put anything in your mouth or in front of it when speaking. Don't smoke, don't eat, don't put your hands in front of your face. Because that makes it hard for a person who is deaf to follow what you're saying. it's pretty irritating to see a cigarette bouncing up and down for example as someone is talking, or or to watch as they are eating and try to speechread what they are saying. Okay, the next one. . . .\n6) Maintain eye contact with the person who is deaf. Don\u2019t just look toward him or her as I said in an earlier item, but it's important that you maintain eye contact. Why is that important ? Eye contact conveys a feeling of direct communication. So you need to have eye contact to make it clear you are in a communication with this person. And here's the really important thing: Even if there is an interpreter is present, alright? You continue to speak and look directly at the person who is deaf. You don't look at the interpreter. The deaf person will turn to the interpreter as they need to. In fact, they may look at the interpreter the whole time, or very frequently. But you continue to look at the person who is deaf. You don't turn to the interpreter.\nNumber 7, now, this one is related to the last one, but number 7 is Use the words \"I\" and \"you\" when communicating through an interpreter. Don\u2019t turn to the interpreter and say \"tell him (blah blah blah); instead tell it to the deaf person directly yourself. Don\u2019t turn to the interpreter or say to the interpreter \"Does she understand me?\"; instead, ask the deaf person directly, \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d. Okay? This is one-to-one communication, not through the interpreter.\n8) Don't stand with a light source behind you. Instead, make sure that the light is on your face, illuminating it. If you have a bright light behind you, it makes it very hard to see you face. There's a glare. It makes it very hard to look at you because of the glare. And there's shadows created on your face, and that makes it almost impossible for a person to speechread, if the person they are looking at has a bright light behind them, so make sure that the light source is in front of you, on your face. Don't sit with the window behind you or something like that.\nNumber 9, number 9. Be courteous to the person during conversation. If the telephone rings or someone knocks at the door, excuse yourself and tell the deaf person what\u2019s happening, and then deal with it. For example, say, \"excuse me. Someone\u2019s at the door.\" Or \"excuse me, the phone is ranging.\" And then handle the interruptions quickly, and return to your original conversation. Don't leave the deaf person just cut out of the conversation while you carry on a conversation with someone else. Okay, so that one was \"be courteous.\" Just use common sense.\nAnd the last one, if you are not understood when you say something, first repeat what you said, and then try to rephrase your thought. Okay? Just don't repeat the same words again. Rephrase them. And don't hesitate to try to communicate with pencil and paper or by typing. Getting the message across is more important than the medium that you use. Okay. So I guess that's it. Ten strategies there. So think about strategies and remember them the next time you have the opportunity to communicate with someone who is deaf or hard of hearing. And it will make the communication go more smoothly. Remember it's not important if you don't know sign language. It would be good for you to learn a few signs at least. But it doesn't matter if you are not fluent in sign language. You can still communicate. The important thing is not how you communicate, not the method that you use, sign or speech. The important thing, the important thing, is that you do communicate. Okay, so, that's all I had to go over today. Does anybody have any questions? Okay well, that's it for today then. I'll see you next time. Bye bye.",

Our process includes the following steps:\n\n \n\nStep 1: Qualification \n\nWe begin by providing candidates with an online coding puzzle followed by reviewing a candidates' portfolios and Github contributions. We recognize that credentials alone do not guarantee a candidate's abilities and thus we judge them on the projects they have contributed to.\n\nStep 2: Introductory Call \n\nWe conduct an introductory video call, so that our recruiters can sell the dream to prospect candidates, providing them with the upcoming hiring process and the perks they can avail, if hired by Storma. \n\nWe treat our candidates like we treat our clients.\n\nStep 3: Additional Coding Tests (online) \n\nWe use 3rd party platforms such as codility or hackerrank to conduct additional coding tests that are integrated into our platform.\n\nStep 4: Personality Test (online) \n\nWe use the Thomas International Personal Profile Analysis (PPA) to measure an individual's natural behavior in the workplace. This helps us to understand an individual\u2019s strengths and areas for development. This is a very important stage in the qualifying process, since we are gaging their mindset and dedication to their craft and identifying which areas we could potentially upskill them in, if they were to be hired by Storma.\n\nNo matter how skilled a candidate might be - If the candidate does not share passion in what they do, we will not hire them.\n\nWe value your heart over your brain. \n\nStep 5: Live Test (online)\n\nWe conduct a virtual live human technical assessment via screen share with a senior developer who is a specialist in the technology the candidate is applying for. This is executed on our platform.\n\nStep 6: Build a Micro-application\n\nCandidates will be given the scope to build a mini project that has the potential to sit as self-contained application on the Storma eco-system. \n\nThis is a take-home technical assessment. Please review: Utilizing Micro-Applications to Identify Top Talent \n\nStep 7: Present Micro-ApplicationsPresent the micro-application to one of our lead senior developers and explain your logic and reasoning behind your code.\n\n \n\nStep 8: Land your dream job.\n\n \n\n \n\n \nUtilizing Micro-Applications to Identify Top Talent\n \n\nOur senior tech leads will orchestrate micro-applications to work on as a way to assess our candidates programming skills as their final test.\n\nBy leveraging a serverless architecture, we have the ability to provide mini coding projects that we call \u201cmicro-applications\u201d, for our candidates to work on as assessments in any programming language that they are being hired for.\n\nWe believe this will not only improve our quality assurance for clients but continually improve and innovate the Storma platform. \n\nWe intend on safeguarding our micro-applications within our quality assurance program by the following factors:\n\n \n\nEstablish clear and consistent evaluation criteria for each step of the process, to ensure that all candidates are being assessed fairly and objectively.\n\nProvide regular training to technical assessors to maintain consistency in the evaluation process.\n\nContinuously gather feedback from clients and candidates and use it to improve the assessment process.\n\nIncorporate a diverse team of assessors to ensure that candidates are evaluated from different perspectives.\n\nHave a clear and consistent feedback process, where the candidates can receive feedback on their micro-applications and learn from their mistakes.\n\nHave a clear communication and expectations with the candidates regarding the assessment process and the expectations.\n\nEnsure that all micro-applications and their associated infrastructure are properly secured and comply with industry-standard security best practices.\n\nBy implementing these additional safeguards, you can ensure that your company's assessment process is effective, fair, and provides a high level of quality assurance in the hiring of software engineers.\n\n \n\nOn-platform Coding Tests\n\nTo free coding tests to qualify candidates \n\nHow to offer on-platform coding tests to not only qualify candidates for interview, but to also Upskill floaters within the company Which 3rd party API\u2019s can we utilize from code review platforms?\n\nHackerrank.comCodesignal.comCodility.ioQualified.ioCodingame.com\n\nAll provide 3rd party API\u2019s, however no API\n\n \n\nLive Code Reviews\n\nVia video conference integration\n\n \n\nPeer to Peer Code Reviews\n\nHow to gamify the code review process, making it more engaging and interactive for developers.\n\nEstablish clear criteria for what constitutes a \"high-quality\" code reviewer.\n\nCreate a certification process for reviewers to ensure that they meet the criteria for being a high-quality code reviewer.\n\nOffer incentives for reviewers to join the platform and keep them engaged. What is a fair incentive for each code review? \n\nWe should offer more than just money + reputation/status - Allow reviewers to gain reputation and status within the platform\n\nCreate a community of reviewers that can support and help each other\n\nAllow for users to rate and provide feedback on other reviewers\n\nLeverage AI technology to assist with the code review process and help the reviewers identify potential issues in the code with more accuracy and speed\n\nHow to implement pair programming to gage candidates in product teamsHow to vet code reviewers? Become Storma Certified?\n\nHow to onboard code reviewers?\n\nLevel up your profile with coding tests reviewed by humans not AI\n\n\"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\" \n\nMartin Fowler\n\nEven in the upcoming age of AI, we at Storma stand by this quote.\n\nAs AI systems become more complex and integrated into various industries, it becomes even more important for the code to be easily understandable by humans.

John Thune, R-N.D., said at a news conference. Thune, a member of Republican leadership and a senior member of the Commerce Committee, is sponsoring the bill with Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va.; the legislation has 10 co-sponsors, five from each party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned about TikTok\u2019s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, which repeatedly, repeatedly spies on American citizens,\u201d Thune added.\n\nBrooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in an email that the Biden administration already has the power to oversee the app through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, and that a blanket ban would be counterproductive for U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that some members of Congress remain willing to explore options for addressing national security concerns that don\u2019t have the effect of censoring millions of Americans,\u201d Oberwetter said. \u201cA U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.\u201d\n\nOberwetter noted that TikTok had negotiated a deal with CFIUS that the Biden administration has been reviewing for six months.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s implications go beyond TikTok. It\u2019s designed to let the federal government pre-empt situations in which technology produced in any of the six authoritarian countries named in the bill becomes popular in the U.S., as was the case with the Russian antivirus company Kaspersky, which is banned on federal computers, and the Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers Huawei and ZTE.\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t explicitly say how a ban would take effect. Warner said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference that it \u201cgives the secretary of commerce a series of tools to mitigate, divest, up to and including banning,\u201d technology that would harm the U.S.\n\nThe tools apply to technology that could be used to interfere in elections, that is designed with deceptive intent or that could otherwise present a national security risk, the bill says.\n\nThe legislation comes in a widespread U.S. crackdown on TikTok. The White House has instructed all federal employees to delete it from their work devices before the end of the month after Congress passed a ban on the app on government devices late last year. A number of state governments have already banned it on work devices, and some universities have blocked students from accessing the site on school Wi-Fi.\n\nLike most phone apps, TikTok has access to and collects substantial user data, which the company says helps improve their experience. The company has had to acknowledge at least one episode in which access to that data was abused. It admitted in December that some employees had spied on journalists\u2019 location data in an attempt to identify which of its employees were speaking to the media.\n\nDespite broad bipartisan support for some sort of crackdown on TikTok, some senators expressed reservations about a narrow approach that doesn\u2019t address data security in a comprehensive way, including regulating the data brokers operating in the U.S. that scrape Americans\u2019 data and sell it, including to foreign companies or entities.\n\n\u201cWhile it is sensible to restrict TikTok on government phones and government interests and the like, if that\u2019s all you do, the big winners are these sleazy private data brokers who will move right in and pick up all of that,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAmerica needs a \u201ccomprehensive policy that starts closing the gaps,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nMany privacy experts say that while TikTok is a threat to Americans\u2019 privacy, it\u2019s not unique in that regard. China\u2019s prolific cyberspies routinely hack Americans\u2019 data. The U.S. has no major data privacy law, and an entire industry of data brokers buys, sells and trades Americans\u2019 private information.\n\nCaitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a think tank, said TikTok represents \u201cmaybe 2% of the problem\u201d when it comes to Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cWithout the coverings of privacy law in the U.S., there are millions of apps that are collecting and abusing Americans\u2019 data,\u201d she said.\n\nNBC News \u00b7 by Kevin Collier and Scott Wong",

Make it longer:\n\nAnd we must be aware of the dangers of personal ambition and the need for humility and a sense of humor. Often time in grassroot organizing, there can be a temptation to succumb to the need for prestige and recognition. It is understandable to want to be acknowledged for the work that has been done, yet too much focus on self-promotion can distract from the larger mission. The cynical pessimist in me sees this trend in activism all too often, leading to an emphasis on the personal gain at the expense of collective progress. Take the examples in Tanjong Karang as an example: some volunteers are there merely to take selfies and share their experiences online, without actually making a tangible contribution to the cause. Though it may be beneficial to build a following in order to spread awareness of an issue, this should never come at the cost of the primary objective. While I was on photographic duty during the campaign, I noticed a few faces often tried to find any avenue to fit themselves in the group photos, even at the cost of ignoring basic protocols. At its early phases this practice might appear insignificant, but when every photos I took was littered with these types of people, it seemed like they were devaluing the work we were doing by taking away from its importance. It is demoralizing to see people who don't understand or prioritize the core mission of a cause and would rather just get their faces seen just for the sake of personal recognition. These are the same person who would decry mundane tasks, when the same tasks might give them an opportunity to prove their worth and demonstrate that they are indeed more than just a face in the crowd. Such practices can be dangerous and harmful to the cause, not only because it undermines the seriousness of the work being done, but also because it sets a bad example for others who are trying to learn from this process . Grassroots activists and new volunteers might be tempted to follow this example of wanting the reward without doing the work. From a Machiavellian standpoint, this could lead to the undoing of a movement by having followers who are looking for instant gratification without putting in any effort. But the solution is simple- organizers, volunteers, and other staff must reprimand such behavior and continue to strive for excellence, dedication, and a higher purpose. Tolerance for people's short-sighted behavior can only go so far, and clear expectations and boundaries must be established in order to build a successful and sustainable movement.",

        "prompt": "Text\uff1a\n\nPolitical changes in the 1990s and textbook revisions\nHowever, even while these texts were being prepared and trialed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the relatively liberal social and political climate out of which they had emerged was being transformed. The CCP interpreted the 1989 Student Movement as the outcome of a failure to \u201ccurb bourgeois liberalism and strengthen public morality,\u201d and urgently sought to reinvigorate its legitimating narrative (Jones, 2005, p. 88). Against this background, patriotism (\u7231\u56fd\u4e3b\u4e49) was given prime billing in a new campaign of thought reform. And from 1992, as a renewed push for market-oriented economic reform was launched, it became clear that the socialist ingredient of the official ideology would be further diluted (Vickers, 2009).\n\nDespite ostensibly continuing to espouse socialism, the CCP increasingly stressed its patriotic credentials as \u201cChina\u2019s past, present, and future saviour\u201d not only from class enemies and foreign imperialists, but also from \u201cChina\u2019s youth\u201d, who had \u201ctasted only the sweet fruits of modernization and not the hard years of bitter struggle, and were thus too easily led astray by the pernicious influences of decadent Western culture\u201d (Jones, 2005, p. 88). Although patriotism had previously been one ingredient in the ideological mix, it was now \u201csingled out as a spiritual crutch for the communist regime\u201d (Zhao, 2004, p. 214). Following various directives on patriotic and moral education after the Tiananmen crackdown, a full-blown Patriotic Education campaign was signalled in a March 1991 letter by Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Jiang urged the use of education to \u201cimprove the self-esteem and confidence of Chinese people, especially Chinese youth, and prevent them being subservient to foreigners\u201d (Jiang, 1991). Greater attention to the teaching of modern and contemporary Chinese history would enable students to understand China\u2019s \u201cnational situation,\u201d18 and thus acquire a \u201ccorrect\u201d understanding of the Party\u2019s leading role (ibid.).\n\nTwo related ministerial directives followed in August 1991, mandating revisions to curricula and textbooks.19 New texts for senior high level were published \u2013 partly to support the teaching of new, compulsory classes in modern Chinese history \u2013 while primary and junior secondary texts were also revised to strengthen the \u201ceducation of thought [\u601d\u60f3\u6559\u80b2] for loving the socialist motherland\u201d (RICT, 2010, pp. 293\u20134, 420). Junior secondary teaching hours at Grade 2 (when modern and contemporary Chinese history were taught) were increased from 2 to 3 hours weekly. Ancient Chinese History, though not singled out in these directives, was also seen as important for reminding students of the \u201cglorious 5,000 years of Chinese civilization,\u201d thereby raising \u201cnational self-respect and self-confidence\u201d to counter the influence of \u201cwestern spiritual pollution\u201d (ibid., pp. 450, 520). Reflecting the new ideological climate, Wang Hongzhi\u2019s writings from the early 1990s also highlight the need to use history education to promote patriotism.20\n\nThe 1988 Curricular Outline and draft 1992 textbooks were revised several times to highlight the theme of patriotism (RICT, 2010, p. 419). In autumn 1989, when the texts were published in an \u201cexperimental\u201d version, the Preface avowed \u201cparticular attention to education in national conditions in order to teach students to love the motherland, the CCP and socialist development, and ensure that they adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles\u201d (ibid., p. 424). Revisions to the \u201cexperimental\u201d version primarily involved modern and contemporary Chinese history, highlighting the themes of imperialist invasion and the united resistance of the Chinese people under CCP leadership (ibid., pp. 450, 456). Content relating to pre-modern periods was also revised, though to a lesser extent, in order to highlight the greatness of Chinese civilization (ibid., pp. 420, 450).21\n\nWith respect to the representation of minority ethnic groups, the formal edition of the 1992 textbooks featured several \u201ctouching stories of the patriotic activities of all ethnic groups\u201d that had not featured in the experimental version. For example, the unit on the Qing (1644\u20131911) included a new passage praising the patriotism of the Panchen Lama in rejecting \u201cthe scheme of the British colonialists\u201d for separating Tibet from China (PEP, 1992c, p. 3). Another passage reinstated from the 1981 texts having been deleted in 1986 recounted the tale of a Mongol people (\u571f\u5c14\u6248\u7279 or Torghut) who overcame various difficulties to return to the motherland (the Qing) from the Volga region of Russia (PEP, 1992c, pp. 2\u20133). This episode was hailed as \u201ca glorious chapter in the consolidation and development of our country as a multi-ethnic state\u201d, earning the Torghut leader Ubashi (\u6e25\u5df4\u9521) \u201cnational hero\u201d status (ibid.). Revisions invariably highlighted the patriotic behaviour of \u201cminority\u201d groups and their contribution to national unity. These changes also reflected rising concern over separatist sentiment among Tibetans and Uyghurs \u2013 concern that dictated greater emphasis on national unity and \u201cinter-ethnic solidarity\u201d.22 While these alterations did not fundamentally affect the core structure or content of the 1992 texts (as detailed above), unity and solidarity would become far more central themes in the subsequent edition.\n\nCurriculum development in the 1990s was subject to contradictory pressures. The Patriotic Education campaign reached a climax in August 1994 with the issuance by the CCP Central Committee of an Outline for Conducting Patriotic Education. There was subsequently to be no let-up in the emphasis on promotion of patriotism as a core function of schooling (Zhao, 2004).23 Meanwhile, however, concerns over the capacity of schools to produce \u201chuman resources\u201d capable of competing in the so-called knowledge economy prompted increased talk of the need for \u201cquality education\u201d (\u7d20\u8d28\u6559\u80b2) to \u201ccomprehensively improve the quality of national citizens and their innovative abilities\u201d (MOE, 1998). In April 1999, the central government mandated a sweeping curriculum reform to focus on cultivating abilities such as innovation, problem-solving and teamwork. The Ministry duly issued a new curriculum standard in 2001, which formed the basis for new textbooks that began to appear that same year. In drafting these texts, which remained in use until 2016, editors had to reconcile the conflicting goals of fostering more critical thinking (for the promotion of technological innovation) and inculcating decidedly uncritical patriotism.",

        "prompt": "can you summarize this paragraph: Neuropsychiatric diseases, including mood and anxiety disorders, are some of the leading causes of disability worldwide and place an enormous economic burden on society (Gustavsson et al., 2011, Whiteford et al., 2013). Approximately one-third of patients will not respond to current antidepressant drugs, and those who do will usually require at least 2\u20134 weeks of treatment before they experience any beneficial effects (Rush et al., 2006). Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and addiction share common neural circuitry (Arnsten, 2009, Russo et al., 2009, Peters et al., 2010, Russo and Nestler, 2013) and have high comorbidity (Kelly and Daley, 2013). A preponderance of evidence from a combination of human imaging, postmortem studies, and animal models suggests that atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression and related disorders and is precipitated and/or exacerbated by stress (Arnsten, 2009, Autry and Monteggia, 2012, Christoffel et al., 2011, Duman and Aghajanian, 2012, Duman et al., 2016, Izquierdo et al., 2006, Pittenger and Duman, 2008, Qiao et al., 2016, Russo and Nestler, 2013). These structural changes, such as the retraction of neurites, loss of dendritic spines, and elimination of synapses, can potentially be counteracted by compounds capable of promoting structural and functional neural plasticity in the PFC (Castr\u00e9n and Antila, 2017, Cramer et al., 2011, Duman, 2002, Hayley and Litteljohn, 2013, Kolb and Muhammad, 2014, Krystal et al., 2009, Mathew et al., 2008), providing a general solution to treating all of these related diseases. However, only a relatively small number of compounds capable of promoting plasticity in the PFC have been identified so far, each with significant drawbacks (Castr\u00e9n and Antila, 2017). Of these, the dissociative anesthetic ketamine has shown the most promise, revitalizing the field of molecular psychiatry in recent years.\nKetamine has demonstrated remarkable clinical potential as a fast-acting antidepressant (Berman et al., 2000, Ionescu et al., 2016, Zarate et al., 2012), even exhibiting efficacy in treatment-resistant populations (DiazGranados et al., 2010, Murrough et al., 2013, Zarate et al., 2006). Additionally, it has shown promise for treating PTSD (Feder et al., 2014) and heroin addiction (Krupitsky et al., 2002). Animal models suggest that its therapeutic effects stem from its ability to promote the growth of dendritic spines, increase the synthesis of synaptic proteins, and strengthen synaptic responses (Autry et al., 2011, Browne and Lucki, 2013, Li et al., 2010).\nLike ketamine, serotonergic psychedelics and entactogens have demonstrated rapid and long-lasting antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in the clinic after a single dose (Bouso et al., 2008, Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017, Grob et al., 2011, Mithoefer et al., 2013, Mithoefer et al., 2016, Nichols et al., 2017, Sanches et al., 2016, Os\u00f3rio et al., 2015), including in treatment-resistant populations (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Carhart-Harris et al., 2017, Mithoefer et al., 2011, Oehen et al., 2013, Rucker et al., 2016). In fact, there have been numerous clinical trials in the past 30 years examining the therapeutic effects of these drugs (Dos Santos et al., 2016), with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) recently receiving the \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d designation by the Food and Drug Administration for treating PTSD. Furthermore, classical psychedelics and entactogens produce antidepressant and anxiolytic responses in rodent behavioral tests, such as the forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018) and fear extinction learning (Cameron et al., 2018, Catlow et al., 2013, Young et al., 2015), paradigms for which ketamine has also been shown to be effective (Autry et al., 2011, Girgenti et al., 2017, Li et al., 2010). Despite the promising antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-addictive properties of serotonergic psychedelics, their therapeutic mechanism of action remains poorly understood, and concerns about safety have severely limited their clinical usefulness.\nBecause of the similarities between classical serotonergic psychedelics and ketamine in both preclinical models and clinical studies, we reasoned that their therapeutic effects might result from a shared ability to promote structural and functional neural plasticity in cortical neurons. Here, we report that serotonergic psychedelics and entactogens from a variety of chemical classes (e.g., amphetamine, tryptamine, and ergoline) display plasticity-promoting properties comparable to or greater than ketamine. Like ketamine, these compounds stimulate structural plasticity by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To classify the growing number of compounds capable of rapidly promoting induced plasticity (Castr\u00e9n and Antila, 2017), we introduce the term \u201cpsychoplastogen,\u201d from the Greek roots psych- (mind), -plast (molded), and -gen (producing). Our work strengthens the growing body of literature indicating that psychoplastogens capable of promoting plasticity in the PFC might have value as fast-acting antidepressants and anxiolytics with efficacy in treatment-resistant populations and suggests that it may be possible to use classical psychedelics as lead structures for identifying safer alternatives.",

MarinaNet offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing and offsetting carbon emissions, simplifying the process and making it accessible and affordable for shipping companies.\n\nMarinaNet is designed to be a one-stop solution for shipping companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint and comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. With MarinaNet, shipping companies can easily track and monitor their emissions, and receive personalized recommendations on how to reduce their emissions and offset their carbon footprint. MarinaNet uses advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide shipping companies with the most effective and efficient solutions for reducing their emissions.\n\nMarinaNet is subscription-based, and charges shipping companies in fiat currency for access to the platform and its features. However, as a reward for using MarinaNet, shipping companies will receive $MRN tokens as a \"cashback\" incentive, which they can use to offset their future subscription fees, or trade on the MarinaX exchange for other carbon credits or stablecoins. This helps to drive adoption and use of $MRN within the MarinaChain ecosystem, and creates a virtuous circle of value for shipping companies and token holders.\n\nFeatures of MarinaNet include:\n\n- \\*\\*Operational Data Collection:\\*\\* MarinaNet collects and aggregates data from a ship's voyage data recorder (VDR), automatic identification system (AIS), and other sensors on-board. This data is then used to calculate the ship's carbon emissions and other environmental metrics.\n- \\*\\*AI-powered Error Correction:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses AI algorithms to automatically detect and correct errors in the data collected from the ship. This ensures that the emissions calculations are accurate and reliable.\n- \\*\\*One-click reporting of Emissions:\\*\\* MarinaNet makes it easy for shipowners to report their emissions to regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. The platform generates the required reports and allows them to be submitted with just a few clicks.\n- \\*\\*Constant Standards Updates:\\*\\* MarinaNet is constantly updated to ensure that it stays compliant with the latest regulations and industry standards. This includes support for initiatives such as the Poseidon Principles, the Sea Cargo Charter, and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII).\n- \\*\\*Cost vs Emissions Optimization:\\*\\* MarinaNet provides recommendations to shipowners on how to optimize their operations to reduce emissions while minimizing costs. This includes suggestions on routes, speeds, and cargo loading patterns.\n- \\*\\*Emissions Benchmarking:\\*\\* MarinaNet allows shipowners to compare their emissions performance with that of other ships in their fleet or with industry benchmarks. This helps them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.\n- \\*\\*Blockchain-based Certifications:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses blockchain technology to provide a transparent and verifiable record of a ship's emissions performance. This allows regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to easily verify the accuracy of the data reported by the shipowner.\n\n-----\n\nI need a step-by-step user flow for these in detail that can be used for my developers and PRD.\n\nSome more details:\n\n1. There are two roles, a Manager and a Ship Crew\n2. Manager Flow: Once a manager logs in, they are greeted with a list of their fleet of ships (the \\*\\*My Vessels\\*\\* page). They can click on a ship to enter the specific ship's page \u2013 specifically its \\*\\*Overview\\*\\* tab \u2013 and see a table summarizing the ship's past daily fuel consumption and speed. This page also has a tab called \\*\\*Submitted Reports\\*\\*, and see the reports submitted by the crew. These reports are grouped by voyage and sorted in chronological order. They can open each report and view the contents.\n3. Crew Flow: A Ship Crew account is tied to a single ship. Once they login for the first time, they are immediately asked to initialize the technical specs for the ship the account is assigned to. Afterwards, they can \\*\\*Create New Voyage\\*\\* and then within the voyage, they can \\*\\*Create New Report\\*\\*. Reports can be one of five types: Noon, Departure, Arrival, Event, and Bunker Delivery Note. The crew then fills in the fields of the report and clicks on the \\*\\*Submit\\*\\* button, at which point it will be sent into the system.",

Google sent me a great phone in an attempt to win me back. I tried for two months and gave up. I thought you might like to see the practical list of reasons.\n\nShort version \u2014 don\u2019t make mail, calendar, and iMessage work on Android and it\u2019s impossible to switch. And make sure G-apps work perfectly on iOS and it will be easy for Droid users to switch. Obvious but true.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nian\n\nian c rogers\n\nLVMH\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nGoogle friends,\n\nThank you again for the excellent phone. The phone is very impressive. I loved it. I used it as my main phone for two months. Unfortunately it\u2019s costing me too much productivity and I need to go back to the iPhone. I thought it might be helpful to explain why:\n\nFirst, the things that are better:\n\nSwiftkeyX murders the Apple keyboard\n\nThe panoramic features on the camera are super fun\n\nNotifications on Android are much more useful than the ones on iPhone\n\nHaving access to settings (bluetooth, wifi, etc) from the notifications pulldown is oft-used\n\nAs you know, I used an Android phone for two years before joining Google. I think I had a great time with it because Beats Music was a Google Apps house and the Google mail/calendar/etc integration is perfect on Android. But since I\u2019m using a combo of Apple Mail (personal mail) and Outlook (work mail), productivity is a real hassle:\n\nMS Outlook is barely usable. A long list of frustrations:\n\nSearch doesn\u2019t find things you know are there. I can search for the same thing in Outlook on Android and iOS Mail and iOS mail will find it instantly, Android will not.\n\nNo inline attachments.\n\n15 wait to load your inbox\n\nNo ability to click phone numbers to call\n\nYou have to context switch inside of the Outlook app to see your calendar\n\nCalandar entries difficult to create\n\nCan\u2019t click on an address in a calendar entry to get to mail.\n\nGmail wasn\u2019t reliable. For some reason I never figured out my me.com mail would update every few hours instead of every few minutes as I had it configured to.\n\nGoogle Calendar doesn\u2019t pull in my Outlook calendar.\n\nThe Android calendar just plain didn\u2019t work.\n\nApple Music won\u2019t download songs for offline use (I get an error every time \u2014 I\u2019m following up with the Apple Music team on this).\n\nGoogle Play music hasn\u2019t improved at all. Very vanilla, boring recommendations, integrated with my mess of old MP3s.\n\nAnd the #1 most difficult to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage. Moving to Android my family was forced to move to Facebook to message me, I used WeChat, WhatsApp and Slack for work, but I missed a ton of messages from friends and family who all use iMessage and kept messaging me at my old address. iMessage amounts to serious lock-in.\n\nI will keep a working SIM in it so I can test our sites and apps on Android (Thank you again, this alone is very helpful) but without fast, reliable access to my mail, calendar, and music I can\u2019t use it as my daily phone anymore. I tried!\n\nThanks again. I hope this is helpful. See you soon.\nFrom: Greg Joswiak\nDate: March 3, 2016 at 10:03 AM PST\nTo: Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, Darin Adler, Phil Schiller\nSubject: Fwd: The Android test\n\nFYI - we hear this a lot.\n\nJoz\nFrom: Phil Schiller\nDate: March 3, 2016 at 10:09 AM PST\nTo: Tim Cook\nSubject: Fwd: The Android test\n\nFYI - note Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why\nFrom: Tim Cook\nDate: March 3, 2016 at 4:28 PM PST\nTo: Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi\nSubject: Fwd: The Android test\n\nSent from my iPad Pro",

        "prompt": "Research and the Evidence Base\nThe focus of research on Bowenian and psychoanalytic therapies has not been on outcome, as is required to be labeled as empirically validated studies (Chapter 2); instead the focus of research has been on the validity of the concepts. Miller, Anderson, and Keala (2004) provide an overview of the research on the validity of the intergenerational theoretical constructs. They found that research supports the relation between differentiation and\n\n(a)\nchronic anxiety\n\n(b)\nmarital satisfaction, and\n\n(c)\npsychological distress.\n\nHowever, there was little support for Bowen\u2019s assumption that people marry a person with a similar level of differentiation or his theories on sibling position; his concept of triangulation received partial empirical support.\n\nOf particular interest to researchers is Bowen\u2019s concept of differentiation of self, which has been the focus of scores of research studies on topics such as client perceptions of the therapeutic alliance (Lambert, 2008), adolescent risk-taking behaviors (Knauth, Skowron, & Escobar, 2006), parenting outcomes in low-income urban families (Skowron, 2005), and adult well-being (Skowron, Holmes, & Sabatelli, 2003). Lawson and Brossart (2003) conducted a study that predicted therapeutic alliance and therapeutic outcome from the therapist\u2019s relationship with his or her parents, providing support for the Bowenian emphasis on the self-of-the-therapist. Another study considering a psychometric measure of differentiation identifies two aspects of differentiation:\n\n(a)\naffect regulation (the ability to regulate one\u2019s expressed mood), and\n\n(b)\nthe ability to negotiate interpersonal togetherness with separateness (Jankowski & Hooper, 2012).\n\nIn regards to psychoanalytic family therapies, significant research has been conducted on the nature of attachment in problem formation (Wood, 2002). The concept of attachment is also central to two empirically supported family therapies: emotionally focused therapy (Chapter 15; Johnson, 2004) and multidimensional therapy (Chapter 5; Liddle, Dakof, Parker, Diamond, Barrett, & Tejeda, 2001). Research is needed on the outcomes and effectiveness of Bowen and psychoanalytic family therapies so that these models can be refined and further developed.",

good for now I don't know if anybody else had He has any other questions but actually wondering if Like in what format would this be presented Like would there just be an iPad rant Emily chillin in our waiting room where patients could go and Use it or do they need a provider with them to like enter the data or like what's the modality I guess\n\nAlika Lafontaine 34:35\nYeah so that'll be Part of what we Get out from the sun As well we'll talk about Different ways that the inputs can be presented And We want to align with what people already do right if you If what people do right now is send kind of an unstructured email That's the way you receive The majority of the concerns they get cheered then If we flag then we can help to build that into your workflow If patients want to put Doing things directly and it doesn't actually require The way that our intake system works It's not the same as a full More reporting system in You have to have the person who experience To put down their name and You know every One who's involved specifically In order to have it kind of aggregate into the dataset You can have the person who experienced it you could have a family member friend who was with them you could have The provider who observed it like you if you hear Six different that happened during the week you could All six of those events and As someone who kind of heard it The second hand So that kind of the way that the data intake is is a lot more flexible because of the way that that we're planning on utilizing the data and As far as patterns versus like special incidences and But that's one thing that We really want to learn from you guys How do people normally share You know and if If the way they normally share is with an iPad in a waiting room then absolutely They feel we can definitely make that happen\n\n36:10\nyeah I think we have client To share a lot of different ways I don't think we have Anyone Like typically complaints I believe are

there's any more really weigh these things are tax holding in our organization\n\nAlika Lafontaine 36:39\nsure Sure I think the\n\n36:41\nmost important thing spectra will be like who they are party will go to and how it will be dressed I think will determine it success because it's being utilized then nothing's being done about it then There's no incentive And so I guess so It'll be interesting to see like how that fits into who Well ultimately be responsible for seeing these trends and themes and how are we going to fit Sam\n\nAlika Lafontaine 37:07\nYeah If You're looking at the specific outputs This just Just generally and obviously this will be kind A cool design thing as far as where that end point It is The real value Are you is twofold the first Is that someone who expressed says these things knows that their story is out there right but they also know that other stories are out there so they can change their behavior You're in order to protect themselves right so that's the first kind of thing value add the second is that it makes it easier for advocates like your site Too be trusted as far as you know When you go into these spaces because how many times Have you you know called up and said you know this happens and these say no it doesn't happen and then something comes in The news and now suddenly they believe you Right and so those are the To have the app What's right now We have extra floored with different sites NBC In Saskatchewan formalized The process of taking Seeing a concern or complaint and having a go into the system bringing with it all the other pattern that came along with All right and so we We can talk about the ticker calories around that you do remain a normal through the whole thing unless you decide to enter in To perform the reporting system because that is requirement of going into the form All reporting system you have to have the person who experienced it be willing to put them in aim down on paper but they'll bring

additional concerns We'd actually flip that around with that hey endof is you'd have have all these different concerns come with to your concern and then You'd go through the investigative process and so those are those are different levels that We can kind of discuss And just like you rightly said It all comes down What makes people feel like this is worth it right like What are those incentives

Built for enterprises to improve the customer support experience while retaining the practices and tools that the Customer Support Team at Vercel had built up over the years. From what customers and the Customer Support Team have told us we've achieved that goal.\n\nFor some background. Before Support Center, customers had to email support before they could get any help \ud83d\ude2c, it was clunky and prone to \\*\"\\*email got sent to spam errors\", and \\*\"\\*I didn't check my email problems\", realizing that the experience wouldn't do, the dev team drafted up the idea to connect the current Salesforce based ticketing system with a UI/UX customers would enjoy.\n\nThe main hiccup we ran into during development was the excessively complex (and archaic) work of integrating with Salesforce and the performance of the support center, of which the solution is caching (the bane of all Software Engineers everywhere).\n\n\ud83d\udcda Fun fact: Salesforces uses a SQL-like syntax for querying data that's similar to SQL but yet very far away from SQL, it's called SOQL, and working with it can be very frustrating\n\nThe problems boiled down to: \n\nHow do you keep the cache always up to date? \n\nHow to keep the support center fast, responsive, and reliable with the most up-to-date info? \n\nHow to make working with Salesforce easier?\n\nThe solution to the first 2 problems... \ud83e\udd41 are webhooks of course. \n\nIn essence, whenever a change is made on Salesforce we call a webhook and have that webhook sync with a cache that we use for the support cases \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nWe can then expand how long the cache should securely hold case data, and add a cache warm-up for when on the main page. \n\nThe last issue was dealing with the complexity of working with Salesforce, we just powered through and though frustrating, I think the results are pretty fantastic.\n\nWorking on this project was awesome, and I'm grateful for being able to work with such a capable team of designers & developers on this project.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f \"",

And that's because they don't do a single thing to actually improve the way your eyes work as you age. \n\nThis Nobel Prize winning scientist helped in discovering the real reason why you're losing your vision and a revolutionary way to reverse your vision problems as you sleep and it has been proven effective for over 13,000 individuals of all ages and health conditions. \n\nThis secret habit is so amazing. It sent the entire eye care industry backwards and they're scrambling to get a high paid solution to make billions from hard working everyday people like you with 13,000 people are already having success after years of suffering poor vision and wearing glasses, contacts and getting needless surgery. \n\nIt's so powerful because it targets the single root cause of vision loss. So if you're suffering from vision impairment, stop everything you're doing and click the link below to watch a short yet powerful video that explains exactly how to reverse vision problems quickly. \n\nAnd this has nothing to do with meds, surgery or expensive treatments. And it works for all types of vision problems, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, blurred vision, you name it. Andy Perth was a new grandpa and was excited to see his granddaughter at the hospital for the very first time except when he got there. \n\nHis vision was so poor, he couldn't even see his granddaughter's face heartbroken and angry, he desperately searched for a solution. And that's when he came across this award winning scientific discovery and a simple ocean creature that was the key to unlocking his vision problem once and for all. After heavily researching a possible solution. \n\nHe put together a remedy based on this prize winning scientific discovery, and he couldn't believe his results. after just one week, his dark blurry spots started to vanish. And by week seven, he could see clearly again for the first time in years, \n\nJen had blood coma that was so bad, she was on the verge of going completely blind. She was at the end of her rope. Fortunately, she knew Andy and after speaking with him about what he found, she was excited to try his new remedy, and she was shocked by how much revision had improved and began to cry tears of joy as her transformation was almost instant and her vision started to clear within the first few days to the point that she can now see objects that she couldn't see at all just a few days before,\n\n so go ahead and click the link below and watch the short life changing video before it's gone.",

        "prompt": "Create a perfect headline title about these articles TikTok is setting a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users who are aged under 18.\n\nIf young people hit the new limit, they will have to enter a passcode to continue to use the service that day.\n\nBut they will be able to opt out of the new measure, which TikTok says will be rolled out \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nThe video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, said it is introducing the feature to help people \"stay in control\" of their use.\n\nTikTok said the new limit comes after it brought in a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time. It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.",

        "prompt": "rewrite: Our aims for this project are to characterize and understand the optimal geometry of Supervised Contrastive Loss (SCL) first proposed by Khosla et. al (2020) to train classification neural networks. Primarily, our interests lie in the neural collapse (NC) phenomena (Papyan et. al 2020) where the last layer representations (embeddings) and the weights of the classification head align and form an equiangular tight frame (ETF) structure. The NC phenomena was first characterized and analyzed for neural networks optimized with Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss. However, recent work has shown that the ETF structure is the optimal geometry for SCL (Graf et al. 2021). Our hope is to fill in the gaps by approaching the problem from an optimization perspective. With this, we see potential in characterizing the geometry once again as an ETF but in addition we will analyze the data-imbalanced setting akin to what was recently accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al. 2022). This approach has a few advantages: (a) we would be able to apply an established optimization framework in order to further understand SCL; (b) it offers the potential to explore modified geometries due to added constraints, such as those imposed by some modern neural networks. Modern deep learning has been moving towards larger models like Transformers trained via unsupervised means, furthermore, recent works have suggested an increased robustness to distributional imbalances in this setting. This work provides a stepping stone in understanding the implicit geometry of unsupervised settings through understanding self-similarity metrics like SCL which are at the core of unsupervised learning.",

        "prompt": "Here is an intro to a paper called TEXTure\n\nTexture transfer is a problem that has received significant attention in the computer graphics and computer vision communities due to its wide range of potential applications. The task of transferring texture from one shape to another can be quite challenging, as it requires not only accurately capturing the appearance of the source texture, but also ensuring that it is coherent with the shape and structure of the target object. This often requires the use of strong geometric priors to guide the transfer process and ensure that the resulting texture looks realistic and believable.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend towards using large diffusion models, such as the u-net, to represent unique concepts and generate new images of these concepts. One example of this is DreamBooth, which fine-tunes a u-net to synthesize novel images of specific objects or scenes. Another example is Textual Inversion, which uses a diffusion model to learn how to represent new text tokens by fine-tuning on a large dataset of text images. These models have proven to be effective at generating high-quality images that capture the desired concepts, and have a wide range of potential applications.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a method for transferring texture between shapes using a diffusion model. Our approach is based on fine-tuning the model to represent the desired texture, and using this representation as a semantic prior to guide the optimization of the texture of a new mesh. To represent the texture concepts, we use UV-maps, which are commonly used to store texture information in computer graphics. However, diffusion models are not typically trained on UV-map images, so we instead fine-tune the model on augmented renders of texture maps. This allows the model to implicitly learn to represent the desired texture, without requiring explicit training on UV-map images.\n\nTo further improve the performance of our method, we use a depth-guided diffusion model, which takes the depth of the target shape into account when synthesizing the texture. This helps to ensure that the transferred texture is coherent with the underlying geometry of the target shape, and results in more realistic and believable texture transfer.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for transferring texture between shapes, we also show that it can be used for texture editing and combining textures from multiple objects, giving it a high level of flexibility. Our method has many merits, including its simplicity and efficiency, and has potential applications in a wide range of fields, including computer graphics, computer vision, and more.",

        "prompt": "Secondary setting: Simia\nSimia is a tiny planet the size of a large moon, orbiting a star on the border of the Luxian Empire. The planet is a warm, humid place, covered almost entirely in untamed jungles. While signs of ancient civilizations are scattered around the planet, currently only one area is inhabited: a pocket of land about the size of a large city, surrounded by a ring of nearly impassable mountains that the inhabitants call the Holy Ring. This is where the only extant civilization on the planet - the Simians - lives. The untamed jungles outside the mountain ring are full of dangerous wildlife that rarely pass through the mountains, making the interior area very safe.\n\nSimian society is rather primitive, comparable to the Bronze Age on Earth. The Simians travel by foot or by riding on tamed beasts of burden from their jungles. They live in wooden \u201ctreehouses\u201d mounted on pillars, or literally built in trees in the more rural areas. These treehouses are connected by swaying rope bridges that allow the inhabitants to move between buildings without touching the ground.\n\nThe Simian society is patriarchal in nature, and their religion is woven into the very fabric of their everyday lives. Even the Holy Ring is believed to be supernatural in nature, as the inhabitants believe their gods raised up the mountains to give them a safe place to live away from the wild beasts outside. They also believe the royal family is directly descended from Shi Huo, the Simian god of war and trickery, through a mortal that he took as his original mate, so the only living member of the \u201csacred bloodline\u201d - Prince Wukong - is revered both as a ruler and as a partially divine being.\n\nThe Simians value individual freedom very highly. This manifests in several of their cultural practices. For example: because Simians believe that the union between a couple is private and no one needs to be involved but the couple, they have no concept of marriage, much less one sanctioned by religion or government. Instead, they simply choose a mate and begin living together.\n\nThe Simians also value the ability to fight and hold one\u2019s own in a battle. Their people have historically had to fight many wild beasts to survive, and while an appearance from one of those beasts is much rarer now, the cultural emphasis on being a warrior still holds strong. This manifests in their religion as well, as Shi Huo is the deity most commonly worshiped.\n\nFinally, although the Simians have no idea, the Luxian Empire has been observing their civilization for quite some time now in preparation for invasion.\nSimians\nSimians are short, monkey-like creatures with long tails and fur. They are bipedal and though they are capable of running rapidly on all fours, they usually prefer not to. Their fur and eyes come in varying shades of brown, black, or flaxen. They usually keep their fur relatively short because of their warm environment, but will sometimes allow it to grow longer, especially on their heads, for the sake of looking attractive. They average 5 feet in height and 55-65 years in lifespan. They are small, light, and fast, and are excellent climbers and swimmers. They often use their tails as an additional limb.\n\nThe Simians wear clothing comparable to that of ancient Chinese peasants or, depending on their social status, semi-nobility. Most lower-ranking monkeys wear simple tops and trousers that don\u2019t get in their way as they work and climb. Fancier clothing for special occasions, or that worn by nobility, consists more of flowing robes and elaborate decorations. The priests and priestesses wear blue and white, while the royal family tends to dress in variations of red and gold. The fighters wear bronze breastplates with intricate designs, and the temple guards have a slightly fancier and lighter version of the breastplate purely for ceremonial purposes. Every Simian, regardless of their social status, has certain patterns or characters embroidered into their clothing. Some are believed to bring good luck. Others represent devotion to the gods. Others might represent the wearer\u2019s family history.\nSimian Religion\nThe Simians believe in three gods: Shi Huo, the \u201cStone Monkey\u201d warrior trickster god, and the first deity to appear; Kwamya, the merciful mother goddess of healing and blessings, and the second deity to appear; and Tapanga, the fierce protector goddess of perfect balance, daughter of Shi Huo and Kwamya. Their religion teaches that Shi Huo originally had a mortal mate, and the semi-divine children they had together became the current Simian royal bloodline. When the mortal mate passed away, Shi Huo took the goddess Kwamya as his new mate and Tapanga resulted from their union. Their relationship forms the basis of the Simian practice of taking mates.\n\nRituals and traditions play an important role in the Simian religion. Most of the worship centers around a large stone temple in Huaguo, the Simian capital city, and many minor shrines are scattered throughout the Ring. The Simians observe holidays such as the solstice, the birth of Tapanga, the creation of the Ring, and more, often with huge festivals.\n\nThe Simians also believe that the Holy Ring was created by the gods to keep the wild beasts or \u201cmonsters\u201d out of their home. Their ancient stories tell of a world rocked by chaos, where monkeys lived in constant fear of being eaten alive by unbeatable monsters. One day, the sky opened up and Shi Huo descended, wiping out many of the monsters after a fierce battle. He then led the surviving monkeys into war against the other beasts and drove them away. Afterward, he conjured up the mountains around their new home to protect them.\n\nBecause the Simians believe their royalty is descended from Shi Huo, the priesthood and the royal family are closely linked. In more recent years, the priests have begun gradually assuming more and more power for themselves and attempting to control the actions of the royal family. To their chagrin, the current heir to the throne - Prince Wukong - couldn\u2019t care less what the priests tell him to do.",

Common barriers to patient-doctor communication include patients\u2019 feeling unable to share information, cognitive impairment in patients, and the dominating nature of the biomedical culture in healthcare. The emergence of new healthcare technologies presents an opportunity to improve healthcare communication through both new tools and shifts in practices. Combined with patient-centered care models of communication, user experience design and operational implementations can be leveraged to improve the quality of the relationship between patient and medical provider, information exchange in the dyad, and shared decision-making. The present research adopts a person-centered care model of communication approach to propose design and operational implementations of eHealth technology to improve patient-doctor interactions, resulting in higher quality healthcare and a reduction in negative health outcomes. Specifically, we propose ways in which eHealth can be used for rapport building, improved information exchange, and higher quality shared decision-making between patients and doctors.",

This can lead to overstocking of some items and understocking of others, resulting in lost sales and wasted inventory.\nHow Tomorrow.io Helps\nBy using Tomorrow.io's proprietary weather models and observations, retailers can access highly localized and high resolution weather data. This allows them to optimize in-store inventory and product placement based on forecasted weather conditions. For example, if the forecast calls for a heat wave, a retailer can increase the stock of summer clothing and accessories. Or if a forecast calls for a cold front, a retailer can increase the stock of winter clothing and accessories. etailers can also create customer tailored insights that give them better situational awareness around the products to place as opposed to receiving just a raw weather forecast. They can receive alerts or visualizations and digests outlining the best or worst products to be focusing given specific triggering conditions. Retailers can also use the historical archived weather information to understand historical trends and how weather has impacted their operations in the past. This helps retailers to make data-driven decisions to optimize their inventory and product placement, leading to increased sales and higher profit margins.\nHow it helps optimize margins\nOptimizing inventory and product placement can help retailers increase sales and reduce waste, leading to higher profit margins.",

Unsure what to do, he reached for his broom and silently began sweeping the floor.\n The broom only made a few strokes before Evanora slammed the door open. \u201cYaldson, what have you done!\u201d\n Jareth jumped. \u201cMistress! I--\u201d\n Evanora yanked off a glove and slapped him. \u201cI keep your family alive, and you repay me by stealing?\u201d\n She knew the fairies were gone. Jareth\u2019s heart raced. As he tried to formulate a response, Evanora seized his arm and dragged him out another door and down a stone hallway. He tried to keep pace with her, but tripped and landed on his knees as she threw him ahead of her into a room full of books. Her eyes flashed with anger. \u201cYou need a lesson in respecting your betters.\u201d\n Jareth tried to stand but winced as his knees protested. \u201cMistress, I did not steal from you--\u201d\n \u201cThree of my most magical specimens are gone!\u201d Evanora snapped. \u201cConfess, coward!\u201d\n Jareth stared at her boots, still unable to rise from his knees. The fairies were only in an oak chest at home--how easy would it be for her to catch them again, and then punish the entire tribe for his rescue attempt\u2026\n The witch snorted in contempt at his silence and raised a fist. Hot, golden energy swirled around Jareth, pinning his arms to his sides and forcing him to his feet. Evanora glared into his frightened eyes. \u201cI shall only ask one time before the punishment, yaldson. What have you done with my specimens?\u201d\n His arms burned painfully where the magical bonds touched bare skin. Jareth couldn\u2019t help but cry out in pain as they tightened, earning a tiny smirk from Evanora. \u201cMistress, please stop!\u201d he managed to choke out.\n \u201cWhere are they?\u201d she repeated.\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d he gasped. Evanora released the bonds and let him stagger back to support himself on her desk, frantically feeling his arms for burns but only finding smooth skin. \u201cThe--the specimens are--\u201d\n He stopped. The truth would doom Zhaleh, Conx, and Gelox, the fairies who had been nothing but kind to him. His scars were gone.\n \u201cThe specimens are dead,\u201d he finally finished, bracing himself for Evanora\u2019s wrath.\n \u201cWhat,\u201d she growled in an unsettlingly calm tone.\n The lie hastily formed in Jareth\u2019s mind. \u201cI mistakenly knocked their cage into the boiling cauldron. I managed to repair the cage but the specimens were killed. Please forgive me, Mistress.\u201d\n Evanora scowled. \u201cWell, I suppose those three were too much trouble anyway. Being boiled alive suits them. But you,\u201d she hissed, yanking Jareth towards her by his sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to ever hide anything from me again. If you so much as draw breath without my permission, I will destroy everyone you love while you watch.\u201d\n \u201cI understand, Mistress. I shall not fail you a second time.\u201d\n \u201cNot if you choose wisely. Now get to polishing those amethysts.\u201d In a swirl of velvet skirts, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him stunned and alone.\n No matter what he chose, someone would suffer.",

Architect demands arbitration under the arbitration clause in the parties\u2019 professional services agreement dated May 1, [D-5], and signed by Warbucks on May 15, [D-5] (the \u201cArbitration Clause\u201d). Section 8.2.4 of the agreement shows that \u201cArbitration pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Agreement\u201d has been checked off. The Arbitration Clause is Section 8.3.1 of the same document and states as follows:\n[A]ny claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement subject to, but not resolved by, mediation shall be subject to arbitration which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be\n- 2 -\nadministered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of this Agreement.\n2. On October 20, [D-2] Architect filed a request to commence mediation with the American Arbitration Association, thereby putting in motion the condition precedent to arbitration. Mediation took place on March 30, [D-1], without resulting in a settlement of the issues. The condition precedent to arbitration has therefore been satisfied, and arbitration should proceed.\nTHE PARTIES\n3. Claimant Columbia Architects is a firm of licensed New York architects providing architecture and interior design services, with an office at 1850 Broadway, New York, NY 10025.\n4. At all relevant times herein and upon information and belief, respondent Warbucks is and was a New York limited liability company with an office at 250 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Warbucks is in the business of developing real estate for commercial and residential use.\n5. In May [D-5] Warbucks engaged Architect to design and provide construction drawings for a twenty-story mixed-use condominium tower in Tribeca, City of New York, with commercial space on the ground floor and nineteen floors of high-end condominium units (one apartment per floor) (the \u201cProject\u201d). The engagement is reflected in the parties\u2019 AIA B101 professional services agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) dated as of May 1, [D-5].\n- 3 -\n6. The Contract provides for compensation to the Architect based in part on percentage of project cost together with a pass-through of consultant charges in accordance with Architects\u2019 consulting agreements. Payments are to be made within thirty days of receipt of bills, subject to interest and an annualized rate of 6 % for late payments.\n7. Over the course of the next three years, Architect performed in accordance with the terms of the Contract by providing design services and construction drawings for the Project. Architect\u2019s performance was at all times consistent with the standard of care expected of an architect in the State of New York.\n8. In contrast, Warbucks has not complied with the terms of the Agreement. It has made a practice of paying roughly 60% of each bill. The first payment was made twenty days after receipt. Since then all payments have been made roughly 90 days following receipt and only after repeated calls.\n9. Warbucks has also paid only 60% of consultants\u2019 charges passed through in accordance with the Agreement. To date, such charges have amounted to $256,000, but Warbucks has paid only $140,000, leaving a balance due of $102,404 consultants\u2019 charges\n10. Architect has also been harmed by delays in the progress of the project, resulting in the need to spend additional time interceding between Warbucks and\nthe Contractor on the job, which has also been short paid and, as a result, has engaged in work slowdowns and other delays.\n11. To date, Architect has been underpaid in the amount of $320,000 in consequence of Warbucks\u2019 pattern and practice of paying less than the full amount of each monthly bill, together with interest that has accrued because of Warbucks\u2019 failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.\n12. The combined charges for which Warbucks is contractually bound to pay Architect come to $422,404, together with contractual interest in the amount of $63,460, thus totaling $485,864.\n13. Architect have also incurred at least 100 hours of extra time for work not originally contemplated in the Agreement, which at $200 per hour amounts to $20,000 in extra compensation to which Architect is entitled.\nWHEREFORE, Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitrator(s) to issue an Award (1) finding Warbucks to have materially breached the Agreement by failure to pay compensation in accordance with the terms thereof and directing payment to Claimant of the sum of $485,864, (2) finding Warbucks to be further liable to Claimant for work beyond\n- 5 -\nthe scope of the Contract in the amount of $20,000, (3) awarding interest on the sums due at the legal rate, and (4) granting such other and further relief as to the Arbitrator(s) may seem just and proper.",

        "prompt": "Summarize this NBC News article about the RESTRICT Act and explain how well it analyzes the bill:\n\nWhite House backs bipartisan bill that could be used to ban TikTok\nNBC News \u00b7 by Kevin Collier and Scott Wong\nA bipartisan group of senators introduced a sweeping bill Tuesday that would allow the federal government to regulate and even ban foreign-produced technology, including TikTok.\n\nThe bill, the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology Act, or RESTRICT Act, would give the secretary of commerce broad power to regulate tech produced by six countries that have adversarial relationships with the U.S.: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.\n\nThe White House endorsed the RESTRICT Act on Tuesday, calling it \u201ca systematic framework for addressing technology-based threats to the security and safety of Americans.\u201d\n\nWhile the bill doesn\u2019t cite TikTok by name, the senators who introduced it repeatedly touched on fears that TikTok, a social video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance that\u2019s wildly popular in the U.S. and around the world, gives Beijing a steady stream of information about its users.\n\n\u201cIt is widely acknowledged that TikTok\u2019s a threat to our national security,\u201d Sen. John Thune, R-N.D., said at a news conference. Thune, a member of Republican leadership and a senior member of the Commerce Committee, is sponsoring the bill with Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va.; the legislation has 10 co-sponsors, five from each party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned about TikTok\u2019s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, which repeatedly, repeatedly spies on American citizens,\u201d Thune added.\n\nBrooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in an email that the Biden administration already has the power to oversee the app through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, and that a blanket ban would be counterproductive for U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that some members of Congress remain willing to explore options for addressing national security concerns that don\u2019t have the effect of censoring millions of Americans,\u201d Oberwetter said. \u201cA U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.\u201d\n\nOberwetter noted that TikTok had negotiated a deal with CFIUS that the Biden administration has been reviewing for six months.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s implications go beyond TikTok. It\u2019s designed to let the federal government pre-empt situations in which technology produced in any of the six authoritarian countries named in the bill becomes popular in the U.S., as was the case with the Russian antivirus company Kaspersky, which is banned on federal computers, and the Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers Huawei and ZTE.\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t explicitly say how a ban would take effect. Warner said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference that it \u201cgives the secretary of commerce a series of tools to mitigate, divest, up to and including banning,\u201d technology that would harm the U.S.\n\nThe tools apply to technology that could be used to interfere in elections, that is designed with deceptive intent or that could otherwise present a national security risk, the bill says.\n\nThe legislation comes in a widespread U.S. crackdown on TikTok. The White House has instructed all federal employees to delete it from their work devices before the end of the month after Congress passed a ban on the app on government devices late last year. A number of state governments have already banned it on work devices, and some universities have blocked students from accessing the site on school Wi-Fi.\n\nLike most phone apps, TikTok has access to and collects substantial user data, which the company says helps improve their experience. The company has had to acknowledge at least one episode in which access to that data was abused. It admitted in December that some employees had spied on journalists\u2019 location data in an attempt to identify which of its employees were speaking to the media.\n\nDespite broad bipartisan support for some sort of crackdown on TikTok, some senators expressed reservations about a narrow approach that doesn\u2019t address data security in a comprehensive way, including regulating the data brokers operating in the U.S. that scrape Americans\u2019 data and sell it, including to foreign companies or entities.\n\n\u201cWhile it is sensible to restrict TikTok on government phones and government interests and the like, if that\u2019s all you do, the big winners are these sleazy private data brokers who will move right in and pick up all of that,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAmerica needs a \u201ccomprehensive policy that starts closing the gaps,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nMany privacy experts say that while TikTok is a threat to Americans\u2019 privacy, it\u2019s not unique in that regard. China\u2019s prolific cyberspies routinely hack Americans\u2019 data. The U.S. has no major data privacy law, and an entire industry of data brokers buys, sells and trades Americans\u2019 private information.\n\nCaitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a think tank, said TikTok represents \u201cmaybe 2% of the problem\u201d when it comes to Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cWithout the coverings of privacy law in the U.S., there are millions of apps that are collecting and abusing Americans\u2019 data,\u201d she said.\n\nNBC News \u00b7 by Kevin Collier and Scott Wong1 / 1",

Additionally, the prices are often very competitive, so I feel like I'm getting a good value for my money.\n\nInterviewer: Have you ever had any concerns about the quality of the appliances you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Not at all. I always make sure to read reviews and do my research before making a purchase. Additionally, many of the sellers on social media are reputable brands that I'm familiar with, so I feel confident in the quality of the products.\n\nInterviewer: Have you had any issues with the delivery or installation of the appliances you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: No, I've never had any issues with delivery or installation. In fact, many of the sellers I've purchased from have offered free delivery and installation, which is a big plus.\n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you've had a very positive experience overall. Based on your experience, would you recommend social media retail for purchasing home appliances to others?\n\nInterviewee: Absolutely. I think social media retail is a great option for anyone looking to purchase high-quality appliances at a competitive price. The convenience of shopping from home and the wide selection of products available make it a great option for anyone in the market for new home appliances.\n\nInterview 6 : 22 Year, male, Food & Grocery\n\nInterviewer: Good morning, thank you for joining us today. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience purchasing food and groceries through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Yes, to be honest, I haven't had a great experience purchasing food and groceries through social media retail. I've found that the selection is limited, the prices are often higher than what I can find in a physical store, and the quality of the products can be questionable.\n\nInterviewer: That's interesting. Can you tell us more about the quality of the products you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Sure, I've had a few experiences where the food or groceries I've received have been expired or close to their expiration date. I've also found that the quality of the produce is often not as good as what I can find in a physical store.\n\nInterviewer: That doesn't sound great. Have you ever had any issues with the delivery of the food or groceries you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Yes, I've had a few experiences where the delivery has been delayed or the products have been damaged during transit. I've also had issues with missing items in my order, which is frustrating.\n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you've had a negative experience overall. Based on your experience, would you recommend social media retail for purchasing food and groceries to others?\n\nInterviewee: Honestly, I would not recommend social media retail for purchasing food and groceries. I think the quality of the products and the delivery issues make it a risky choice. In my opinion, it's better to go to a physical store where you can see the products and make sure they're fresh and of good quality.\n\nInterview 7 : 35 Year, female, Beauty Products\n\nInterviewer: Good morning, thank you for joining us today. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience purchasing beauty products through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Yes, I've had a mixed experience purchasing beauty products through social media retail. There are definitely some benefits to shopping for beauty products online, but there are also some downsides.\n\nInterviewer: Can you tell us more about the benefits you've experienced when purchasing beauty products through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Sure, one of the biggest benefits is the wide selection of products available. I've been able to find a lot of unique and hard-to-find products that I wouldn't be able to find in a physical store. Additionally, the convenience of shopping from home is a big plus.\n\nInterviewer: That's great to hear. What about the downsides? Can you tell us about some of the challenges you've faced when purchasing beauty products through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: One of the biggest challenges is not being able to see and touch the products in person. Sometimes the color or texture of a product can be different in person than what is shown in the online images. Additionally, I've had a few experiences where the products I've received have been expired or close to their expiration date.\n\nInterviewer: Have you ever had any concerns about the authenticity of the beauty products you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Yes, I've definitely had concerns about the authenticity of the products. There are a lot of sellers on social media who claim to sell authentic products, but it can be hard to tell if they are actually legitimate. I always make sure to do my research and read reviews before making a purchase.\n\nInterviewer: Based on your experience, would you recommend social media retail for purchasing beauty products to others?\n\nInterviewee: It really depends on the individual and what they are looking for. If someone is looking for a wide selection of unique and hard-to-find beauty products, then social media retail could be a good option. However, if someone is looking for more mainstream products or is concerned about the authenticity and quality of the products, then they might be better off shopping in a physical store.\n\nInterview 8 : 50 Year, female, Artisanal Products\n\nInterviewer: Good morning, thank you for joining us today. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience purchasing unique and artisanal products through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Sure, I've had a really positive experience purchasing unique and artisanal products through social media retail. It's been a great way for me to discover new and unique products that I wouldn't be able to find in a physical store.\n\nInterviewer: That's great to hear. Can you tell us about some of the unique products you've discovered through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Sure, I've discovered a lot of great products, such as handmade jewelry, unique home decor items, and artisanal food products. I've also been able to find a lot of great gifts for friends and family that are really unique and special.\n\nInterviewer: That's really interesting. Have you had any concerns about the quality or authenticity of the products you've purchased through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Not really. I always make sure to do my research and read reviews before making a purchase. I've also found that a lot of the sellers on social media are really passionate about their products and take great care in making sure they are of good quality.\n\nInterviewer: That's great to hear. Do you have any tips for others who are interested in purchasing unique and artisanal products through social media retail?\n\nInterviewee: Sure, my biggest tip would be to do your research and read reviews before making a purchase. It's also important to make sure that you are purchasing from a reputable seller who has a good track record of providing quality products and excellent customer service. Additionally, it's always a good idea to check the return policy before making a purchase, just in case you need to return the product for any reason.\n\nnext 4 interviews.

        "prompt": "Create a perfect headline title about these articles TikTok is setting a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users who are aged under 18.\n\nIf young people hit the new limit, they will have to enter a passcode to continue to use the service that day.\n\nBut they will be able to opt out of the new measure, which TikTok says will be rolled out \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nThe video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, said it is introducing the feature to help people \"stay in control\" of their use.\n\nTikTok said the new limit comes after it brought in a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time. It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.",

        "prompt": "Take this story and improve it. Keep the story the same but give describe the surroundings, feelings, and thoughts more meaningfully to paint a picture in a person's mind with your words.\n\nThe origin story of the Duulo-Vraktor bloodline has been passed down for generations. It all started with Mitne, a dragon deity with glossy rainbow scales. He was the guardian of the forest and kept the natural balance. Mitne had long transcended past pride many years before time or history was a concept. For this reason, he regarded everything in the forest as his equal and took his time building meaningful friendships with all life. \n\nElves, often being a very traditional race, lived in harmony with the forest and their friend. Many generations of elves learned much from Mitne and he cherished the elves' sincerity and mistakes in their short lives of around 750 years which to him was like the blink of an eye. All they had ever known was peace as far as they could remember. \n\nThose who stumbled onto the forest would be in natural awe of Mitne and those who came with bad intentions had their hearts purified at the sight of him and their souls soothed when he spoke to them. For the first time, those people felt the shadows in their heart lifted, seeing the world with fresh eyes. Finally they could hear nature's timeless song: the gentle wind that makes the grass whistle, a drop of dew falling from the leaf of a tree onto a rock and dirt, the dancing leaves and petals as they fell and were swept up again. One sobbing person worked up all his strength to ask Mitne, \"I have done much evil for the sake of my own greed and lust. I came to plunder your forest yet your presence lifted all the clouds in me, like I am a newborn again. How have you done this?\"\n\nMitne never looked away from the man. He always listened mindfully. The great dragon closed his eyes not to ponder the question for he knew the answer. He just listened to nature's timeless song for a moment longer with the man. \"Thank you.\", said the man.\n\nMitne replied, \"I gave you a taste of the essence of true divinity. If there is still some good in one's heart then it cleanses all impurities. True evil is very rare. If no goodness is left in a creature, then darkness will attempt to consume the divinity and fail. Darkness promises power and when it's overwhelmed by the light, which is the very thing it abandoned for power it will cause the mind to go mad from fear and die. In these cases I cleanse the souls and they enter the cycle of rebirth.\"\n\nThe man had just been given insight into the great order and broke down crying.\n\n\"You have grasped the true weight of your own guilt. Your tears are a testament to your sincerity as you mourn the futures of others that you took. Punishment is not the answer to atonement. Live by finding your own path to divinity.\"\n\n\"Where do I start?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. Fill the world with flowers so that others may hear nature's timeless song as you have today.\"\n\nHe had found his resolve and walked onward without looking back out of respect for Mitne. He knew Mitne regarded him as a friend, something he never imagined could happen before that day, so he went out to become someone worthy of the trust of a real friend.\n\nMany tribes had populated the forest over many centuries. One day Mitne went to each tribe to announce he was leaving. The news was really sudden. There was no great conflict or grand reason. He just said it was time to go. He told everyone, when he goes, the egg of his nextborn will be created. The day of departure came and everyone made a circle around his favorite resting spot and smiled so the last thing he would see before returning to the gods would be joy in the faces of all his friends. \n\nHe knew how their hearts truly wept. He was honored, his last words: \"I am always with you all, my dear friends.\" \n\nTime and space twisted and distorted and flashed and he was gone leaving a rainbow scaled egg behind.\n\nA young prodigious diviner forth saw the hatching of the next forest guardian was to be on the very next day.\n\nBy the egg's will, only the youth from all life of the forest had been summoned to come that night to witness the awakening. As the sun set and the moon reached its peak on the starry, black canvas, the young diviner strummed her harp, the youth played their forest flutes, and the forest creatures howled, and roared, and watched as the egg slowly cracked and a beautiful, colossal creature emerged. \n\nEveryone went silent. The new rainbow dragon looked around at every creature for a while and finally broke the silence with a greeting.\n\n\"I am Duulo.\" \n\nAs a diety, Duulo was born with great knowledge of himself, his name, and his purpose. Mitne's rainbow scales would sparkle poetically from each of the sun ray's kisses, while Duulo appeared to shine his own hue beside the moonlight.\n\n\"My father has kept this forest in a state of everlasting peace for as long as it has existed. The creatures of the forest are strong and many beyond this forest have been saved and feel indebted to my father. His gift to his friends was the strength to overcome your own battles. I will guide you to fully realizing that strength but your battles are your own to fight. So youth of this forest, you all will one day set out to see this world and grow in a new way, so hone your path until then. Carry on this message after you make your way back home.\"\n\nAs the sun rose Duulo curled up and went to sleep.\n\nHis message came as a surprise to many in the forest. The diviners confirmed that if the forest didn't prepare and heed Duulo's words that for the first time in their history they would not be ready for the battles to come.\n\nDuulo woke up every night and many came to him for advice. Trade opened up to the neighboring villages and kingdoms. The artisans, great sorcerers, bards, storytellers and many more built up great influence. \n\nThe young diviner prodigy watched the moon every night while strumming her harp and Duulo would join her. This continued for hundreds of years. The forest and it's folk had succeeded and grown. Finally it was time for all the youth to set out.\n\nDuulo told that it too was his time to go, that the forest was now in the hands of it's creatures.\n\nThe young prodigious diviner was named Ernaya. She was blind from birth but saw the world through various futures because of her gift. Duulo has been quietly in love with her for centuries. He would not be bound by divine duty. Although many dragons are splendid shapeshifters, Duulo did something even Ernaya nor even the heavens could foresee, he reincarnated as a mortal, freeing himself from his duty. He also healed Ernaya's eyes and changed her fate. They went on countless adventures together. Duulo never hid who he was. The forest people came to accept Duulo's choice and love for Ernaya. Their family name became known as the Duulo-Vraktor with a lineage that lives to this day. Elves of Duulo's blood continue the pilgrimage that their ancestors once took, seeking their own answers to freedom. The dragon blood manifests itself at it's prime in those who discover the price that freedom comes at and their children are also blessed with strong dragon blood as well.\n\nNot everyone returns, but in honoring this tradition none regret seeking the answer.",

A case in point is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which operates in buildings and other facilities owned by the government, in leased spaces, and in contractor-provided facilities. DHS also provides directives to other U.S. government agencies, and organizations that support those agencies, about meeting their roles in critical infrastructure protection. In doing so, DHS\u2019 approach to PACS demonstrates the application of a number of the security concepts, access control models, and access control techniques examined in this chapter thus far.\n\nPlease read the following case information, then answer a few key questions related to PACS.\n\nPhysical Access Control Systems (PACS) Case Study: U.S. Department of Homeland Security\nPACS as used by the United States Department of Homeland Security are divided into four areas that operate independently at the direction of the PACS administrator:\n\nIdentification:\u202fPACS requires an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information (PII) so it can authorize physical access to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) facilities. PACS sensors read the information on an individual\u2019s personal identity verification (PIV) card to verify if the individual has authorized access.\nVisitor management:\u202fVisitors and construction and service contractors who have not been issued a PIV card must be identified before being granted access.\nParking permit management:\u202fThe Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO) uses PACS to issue and track parking permits. OCAO personnel access PACS to determine\u202fif an\u202findividual is eligible to receive a parking permit. Upon issuance of the parking permit, OCAO personnel enter into PACS the name and email address of the permit holder, the permit number and type, issue date, and expiration date.\nAlarm monitoring and intrusion detection:\u202fThe PACS alarm monitoring application allows OCAO personnel to monitor the intrusion detection system (IDS). A record is created in PACS of all IDS alarm activations or other issues, such as communication and power failures. The IDS in PACS consists of sensors, lights, and other mechanisms through which Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO) can detect the unauthorized intrusion of persons or devices. The only PII collected by the PACS IDS suite is the first and last name of the individual authorized to turn the alarm system on and off and the corresponding PIN code, which the individual inputs into the alarm keypad to activate or deactivate the alarm.\nInstructions\nPlease consider the following questions and provide a quick response so you may check if you feel confident expressing these concepts.\n\nWhat distinct roles are there within the physical access control system (PACS) application\u2019s four areas? What are general security roles that can be used as placeholders for the PACS application roles?\n\nName the logical or physical systems that are described in the PACS application.\n\nWhat assumptions could you make about the nature of the information related to identification in the PACS application?\n\nYou\u2019ll note that DHS seems to view the controlling of access to physical facilities as a separate and distinct set of problems and requiring separate policies, rather than providing access control to information systems. Why might they have this view?",

Content Platform in Messenger\n\n- Turning stickers into an open market\n\n- Adding memes and videos to the market\n\n- Building a simple in-message games platform\n\n3. App-to-person messages and agents\n\n- Enabling apps and pages to send messages, with strict controls to ensure quality\n\n- Enabling people to send messages to apps and pages and get replies\n\n4. Messenger Agent Platform\n\n- Building a meta-agent and a platform to let agents register to take on tasks\n\nIf we want to develop some of these ideas, we would need to determine which teams will be building which pieces. I imagine that the Platform team would do most of the work for (1) and (4), but the Messenger team would perhaps do most of the work for (2) and (3). All of these will likely require some work and full support from both teams though, so a good next step is to figure out which of these we are excited about building now.\n\nI know this was very long, so I appreciate that you've read all the way down to here and are taking the time to consider this carefully. If it makes you feel better about having to read all of this, just think about how long it took me to write on my phone! Please take the time to think through this, because I wouldn't have spent hours writing it up if I didn't seriously believe there was something important here to consider now.\nWhat is mark zuckerberg trying to convey",

Then, the background information is \"Background \nDifferent species of plants react to stresses in different ways. For example, grasslands are quite sensitive to drought. Droughts occur at varying frequencies and varying levels of severity. Numerous observations suggest that the number of different species present plays a role in how a plant community adapts when exposed to cycles of drought over successive generations. In some communities with only one species of plant, the generations that follow are not as well adapted to drought conditions as the individual plants in communities with four or more species. These observations raise many questions. For example, what is the minimal number of species necessary for a plant community to benefit from this type of localized biodiversity? How does this phenomenon scale as the number of species increases? What does this imply for the long\u0002term survivability of a plant community\" Later I will give you a few requirements and you need to build the math model and do some simulations, understand? just tell me if you understand the task",

It addresses the current limitations of the carbon offset market, including the lack of traceability and the dominance of a few standard bodies. The use of blockchain technology and machine learning allows for the creation of a transparent and scalable solution. The project also has the potential to become a carbon offset standards body and certification body, further disrupting the market.\nIntroduction\nThe voluntary carbon offset market is a growing industry that allows individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These projects include reforestation, renewable energy, and methane capture. Carbon credits are issued by standards bodies such as Verra for projects that meet certain environmental standards.\nHowever, the current carbon offset market is limited by a lack of traceability and the dominance of a few standard bodies. It is also difficult for small players to enter the market and for consumers to confidently purchase carbon offsets.\nThe Eco project addresses these limitations by utilizing smart contracts and machine learning to create the world's first decentralized autonomous carbon offset registry. It is built on the Polygon blockchain and allows users to tokenize carbon credits. These carbon credits are bridged onto the Polygon blockchain and deposited in a Carbon Pool, where they are transformed into fungible tokens called carbon reference tokens. These tokens can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nThe unique selling point of the Eco project is its focus on forward selling of carbon reference tokens. This allows for the creation of a new market for carbon offsets and incentivizes all participants to trust the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its token.\nDAO Governance\nThe DAO governance structure is designed to be efficient and cater to the forward carbon reference tokens market. It includes various stakeholders such as Forest engineers, land owners, carbon offset buyers, and solidity coders. The DAO will also collaborate with companies such as Skylab, which provides precision forestry AI and advanced aerial data analytics for digital forest management.\nThe DAO will be responsible for the issuance and management of carbon reference tokens, as well as the development and maintenance of the Carbon Bridge, an application that allows for the seamless transfer of carbon credits onto the Polygon blockchain. The Carbon Bridge will be open source and allow for the integration of other carbon offset projects onto the Eco platform.\nToken Economics\ncontinue pleasse\nSure, I can continue to generate the text of the white paper here.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Eco project is an innovative solution for the voluntary carbon offset market, using blockchain technology and machine learning to create a decentralized, autonomous carbon offset registry. The project aims to address the current challenges and inefficiencies in the carbon offset market, such as the lack of transparency, standardization, and trust, by providing a secure, transparent, and verifiable platform for the issuance, tracking, and trading of carbon offsets.\nThe core of the Eco project is the Eco token, a smart contract-based token on the Polygon blockchain that represents a carbon offset. The Eco token is backed by real-world carbon credits issued by recognized standards bodies, such as Verra, for projects that engage in activities that meet certain environmental standards, such as reforestation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. The Eco token allows these carbon credits to be bridged onto the Polygon blockchain and deposited in a Carbon Pool, where they are transformed into fungible tokens called carbon reference tokens. These carbon reference tokens can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nThe Eco project also includes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a self-governed and decentralized platform for decision-making and value creation, based on smart contracts and voting mechanisms. The Eco DAO will be responsible for the governance, management, and operation of the Eco project, including the issuance, distribution, and retirement of the Eco tokens, as well as the development and implementation of new features and applications. The Eco DAO will be open, transparent, and inclusive, allowing all stakeholders, such as carbon offset buyers, sellers, developers, and users, to participate and contribute to the growth and success of the Eco project.\nThe Eco project represents a unique opportunity to create a new ecosystem for carbon offsets, based on blockchain and machine learning, that is more efficient, effective, and fair than the existing solutions. The Eco project will not only provide a new and innovative way to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change, but also generate new value, opportunities, and jobs for all participants in the carbon offset market.\n\nTechnology:\nThe Eco project is built on the Polygon blockchain, a high-performance and scalable platform for the Web3 ecosystem, that supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The Polygon blockchain is designed to provide fast, cheap, and secure transactions, as well as interoperability with other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, through the use of sidechains and bridges. The Polygon blockchain is also equipped with advanced features, such as sharding, plasma, and zk-SNARKs, that enable scalability, privacy, and security, for the Eco project and other Web3 applications.\nThe Eco token is a standard ERC-20 token on the Polygon blockchain, that implements a set of smart contracts and functions, for the issuance, distribution, and retirement of the tokens. The smart contracts of the Eco token are open-source and auditable, allowing anyone to verify and validate the code and the logic behind the token. The smart contracts of the Eco token also include a Carbon Pool contract, that manages the carbon reference tokens and the carbon credits, and a Voting contract, that enables the Eco DAO to make decisions and proposals through a voting process.\nThe Eco DAO is a standard DAO framework on the Polygon blockchain, that implements a set of smart contracts and functions, for the governance, management, and operation of the Eco project. The smart contracts of the Eco DAO are open-source and auditable, allowing anyone to verify and validate the code and\nwhat else is missing ?\nI apologize, but I am unable to send you the white paper as I am a text-based AI and do not have the ability to send documents or access external sources of information. I can only generate text based on the information and instructions provided to me. If you would like to continue discussing your project and ideas, I would be happy to assist you. Please let me know if you have any specific questions or areas you would like to discuss further.\nhow about if we break the text into sections and start sending me section by section ?\nSure, that sounds like a good plan. Here is the first section:\nIntroduction\nEco is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem for the voluntary carbon offset market. The goal of Eco is to provide a transparent and efficient platform that allows individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. These credits represent the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through activities such as reforestation, renewable energy projects, and energy efficiency improvements. By participating in Eco, individuals and businesses can offset their carbon emissions and mitigate their impact on the environment.\nOne of the key features of Eco is its use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. These technologies enable Eco to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for the trading of carbon credits. Eco will use a carbon reference token, which will be backed by verifiable carbon credits that have been issued by recognized standards bodies such as Verra. These carbon reference tokens can be traded on the platform, allowing individuals and businesses to easily offset their carbon emissions.\nIn addition to facilitating the trading of carbon credits, Eco also aims to provide a range of tools and services to support the development and implementation of carbon offset projects. This includes providing technical assistance to project developers, connecting projects with potential funders, and offering financing options to support the development of new projects. By providing these services, Eco hopes to make it easier for individuals and businesses to offset their carbon emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change.\nnext section please\nSure, here is the next sction of the white paper:",

I thought I could take a taxi, but my friend worried that he wouldn't get a taxi here. Standing on the main street for about 20 minutes, only receiving one-sided rejection from Kakao, the hope circuit gradually went out, and we turned our worries about not being able to find a taxi into certainty. Once we decided to cross the river, we boarded any bus that went to Gangbuk, and my friend got off at the nearest stop and walked for 30 minutes. I tried to do the same, but I got off the plane and tried to get a taxi again. After getting off, the taxi driver never asks for bait again, and my mind goes blank, and to make matters worse, I realize that the bus I rode on was the last bus. I was seriously thinking about going by Singssingi, but feeling like a madman, I sat at a 24-hour fast food restaurant and waited for about 30 minutes to catch a late-night bus. The time spent wandering outside worrying about it must have been about 10 minutes. But during that short time, I really wanted to go home. At that time, I could keenly feel how much I missed my home, how precious it was to me, and how cold the street was after this winter. If I had taken a taxi, it took more than 2 hours to get home from a distance that would have taken 20 minutes.\n\nIn the future, when there is a notation \\*\\*, the above text is called.\nAnd the prompt is called in the form of \"\\*\\*, movie scenario\".\n \n \n \ubc88\uc5ed \ucde8\uc18c\ud558\uae30\n \n \n\uc9c0\uae08\ubd80\ud130 \uae00\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub4ec\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud558\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\\*\\*)\n\n\\*\\*\n\ub098\ub294 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\uacfc \ub180\ub2e4\uac00 \ub9c9\ucc28\ub97c \uc9c0\ub098\ucce4\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 \ud0dd\uc2dc\ub97c \ud0c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uc904 \uc54c\uc558\ub294\ub370, \uce5c\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dd\uc2dc\ub97c \ud0c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744\uae4c \uac71\uc815\ud588\ub2e4. 20\ubd84 \uc815\ub3c4 \ub300\ub85c\ubcc0\uc5d0 \uc11c\uc11c \uce74\uce74\uc624\uc758 \uc77c\ubc29\uc801\uc778 \uac70\uc808\ub9cc \ubc1b\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc810\ucc28 \ud76c\ub9dd\ud68c\ub85c\ub294 \ube60\uc838\ub098\uac14\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0dd\uc2dc\ub97c \ubabb \uc7a1\uaca0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac71\uc815\uc744 \ud655\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \ub3cc\ub838\ub2e4. \uac15\uc744 \uac74\ub108\uae30\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ubd81\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc544\ubb34 \ubc84\uc2a4\ub098 \ud0d4\uace0 \uce5c\uad6c\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc815\ub958\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\ub824 30\ubd84\uc744 \uac78\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub3c4 \ub611\uac19\uc774 \ud574\ubcf4\ub824\uace0 \ud588\ub294\ub370 \ube44\ud589\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\ub824\uc11c \ub610 \ud0dd\uc2dc\ud0c0\ub824\uace0 \ud588\uc5b4\uc694. \ud558\ucc28 \ud6c4 \ud0dd\uc2dc\uae30\uc0ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ub294 \ubbf8\ub07c\ub97c \ubb3b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc815\uc2e0\uc774 \uba4d\ud574\uc9c0\uba70 \u200b\u200b\uc124\uc0c1\uac00\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\uac00 \ud0d4\ub358 \ubc84\uc2a4\uac00 \ub9c9\ucc28\uc600\uc74c\uc744 \uae68\ub2eb\ub294\ub2e4. \uc9c4\uc9c0\ud558\uac8c \uc2f1\uc2f1\uc774 \uac08\uae4c \uace0\ubbfc\ud558\ub2e4\uac00 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub188\uc774 \ub41c \uae30\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c 24\uc2dc\uac04 \ud558\ub294 \ud328\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud478\ub4dc\uc810\uc5d0 \uc549\uc544 \uc2ec\uc57c\ubc84\uc2a4\ub97c \ud0c0\ub824\uace0 30\ubd84 \uc815\ub3c4 \uae30\ub2e4\ub838\ub2e4. \uace0\ubbfc\ud558\uba70 \ubc16\uc744 \ud5e4\ub9e4\ub358 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 10\ubd84 \uc815\ub3c4\uc600\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub098\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc9d1\uc5d0 \uac00\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub54c \ub098\ub294 \uc9d1\uc774 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uadf8\ub9ac\uc6e0\ub294\uc9c0, \ub098\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc18c\uc911\ud55c\uc9c0, \uc774 \uaca8\uc6b8\uc774 \uc9c0\ub098\uace0 \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ucd94\uc6e0\ub294\uc9c0 \ubf08\uc800\ub9ac\uac8c \ub290\uaf08\ub2e4. \ud0dd\uc2dc\ub97c \ud0d4\ub2e4\uba74 20\ubd84 \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\uae4c\uc9c0 2\uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac78\ub838\ub2e4.\n\n\uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \\*\\*\ub77c\ub294 \ud45c\uae30\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c \uc704\uc758 \ubb38\uc790\uac00 \ud638\ucd9c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \"\\*\\*, \uc601\ud654 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\" \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud638\ucd9c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.",

Not only do literacy narratives discuss memories, but they also walk through a person\u2019s discovery, trials and triumphs with reading, writing and speaking a language.\nHook: Begin with a hook to draw the reader in. This could be your first experience with books or how reading and writing define you.\nFocus: Rounding out your first paragraph, you\u2019ll want to give a short thesis that tells the reader the whole point of your story.\nMeaning: Throughout the remainder of your narrative, you\u2019ll use stories and vivid descriptions to explore the meaning of this journey to you. You might discuss how your poetry has grown or your love of reading has turned into writing.\nChallenges: Explore the challenges that you\u2019ve faced in your journey and how you\u2019ve overcome them, along with how your ideas and thoughts have transformed.\n\nSample Literacy Narrative by Jennifer Betts:\n\"\"\"\"Words were like a puzzle that I couldn\u2019t quite solve. Listening to the teachers read the jumbled-up letters on the page, I was fascinated by how they could easily bring the pictures to life. The first day that I truly became literate, it was like another world opening up. My fingers couldn\u2019t find books fast enough. My relationship with words has been a powerful, fantastical and even sometimes disastrous journey.\n\nI would like to say that I\u2019ve always known the power of words, but that simply isn\u2019t true. The power that a word can hold jumped at me like a thief in the night the first time I encountered my own personal bully. They took the words that I\u2019d proudly written and made them less meaningful than trash. However, it was that bully that forced my reading and vocabulary to grow. They made me realize the power that a few sentences could hold in an instant. Like swords in battle, they can quickly cut and decimate your opponent. Mastering the tactics of battle, you turn from the opponent to the victor. The need to be the victor drove me to books. And books opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking.\n\nI have that bully to thank for leading me to the children\u2019s book Harry Potter. The moment I slid open those silken pages, my eyes couldn\u2019t devour them fast enough. The story pushed the limits of my vast imagination and truly allowed me to soar. The moment the journey was over, I missed it. And there hasn\u2019t been another book since that has truly satisfied that high.\n\nWhile I had dabbled in writing my own love stories a time or two, my need to find another fantasy that consumed me like the Harry Potter series pushed me into trying my own hand at writing. The moment my fingers hit the keys, the words just started pouring out of me at a rate that even I couldn\u2019t control. Who knew that the shy, introverted child had so much to say?\n\nWhile my relationship with written words are the things of dreams, my plunge into speaking often has disastrous consequences. Never have I been a good public speaker. In school, it was the day that I dreaded. Despite my preparation, I would trip and stumble to the podium only to repeat my performance in my carefully planned words. While they say practice makes perfect, in my case, practice has made mediocre. But to get the world to hear your words, sometimes you need to find the courage to speak them.\n\nEven if the delivery isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nThough my journey with words started in frustration, it turned to fascination and wonder in a minute. Even with many years of reading under my belt, I\u2019m still humbled by the power that a single word can hold if used the right or even the wrong way. Sharper than knives or softer than a silk, finding the right words is always an interesting journey.\"\"\"\"\n\nMy literacy narrative: \"\"\"",

While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",

Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 \u2018[t] hose polities are very large in area\u2019\u2014indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent\u2014Australia\u2019s uniform evidence law scheme has clear \u2018majority\u2019 status in two respects: \n\n\u2022 by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation\u2019s ten court systems \n\u2022 by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory\u2019s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia\u2019s mostly abandoned \u2018common law of evidence\u2019, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading \u2018 Common law \u2019) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], \u2018 Uniform law \u2019.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law\u2019s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme\u2019s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law",

        "id": "3D3oQC0_96",
        "prompt": "Think how your body behaves in noncreep mode. When we are in good posture, that is. When you maintain a neutral spine (we\u2019ll get into the details of this critical concept in a moment), the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules in and around your spine are all rigid and taut and in balance. They hold you up. They supply stability and support to your spine and keep it neutral. It is a big deal and quite complicated. The muscles supporting the spine, especially the little ones in and around your vertebrae called \u201cmultifidi,\u201d have lots of mechanoreceptors (little sensory organs) that respond to physical, mechanical stimuli such as touch or load. Those little ones help us maintain a safe spinal position via reflexes. Not the big reflexes like the one that jerks your leg when the doc taps your knee in a certain place. Little guys that do the same thing on a much smaller scale. But these little guys do big work. They trigger lightning-quick changes in muscle tension and joint stiffness to allow us to make minute changes in spine position and muscle strength, preventing overload of the spine. This is going on all the time in our bodies, and it matters tremendously. \nThink of creep like this. Think of an elastic band that has been stretched too far or for too long and becomes dusty, slack, and ineffectual. That happens to your muscles with creep. Also, the joints in the area become less stable as the muscles get lopsided. Finally, the nervous system, which manages those reflexes, gets hobbled, too. And the wrong signals (or no signals) are sent, which causes even more profound deformation. The whole system of small muscles and related nerves that hold the back in a good place goes to hell. And so does your back. \nCreep causes pain, all on its own. That\u2019s because the little muscles around the joint sense that something is terribly wrong, and they spasm, in an effort to hold the status quo and protect unstable joint segments. Spasms hurt. Second, if you put a load on an unstable joint, it is not able to sustain that pressure, and major damage can occur such as a disc herniation or ligament sprain. That hurts, too. \nFinally, creep sets you up for that \u201csudden\u201d movement that you think is the cause of your back pain. Here is a good example: Think of a fireman sitting, stock-still, in the fire station for ten hours. He\u2019s in some kind of bad posture and he holds that bad posture so long that creep occurs. Now the bell goes off, he goes flying down the fire pole or whatever, and rushes out to the fire. Maybe he picks up a super-heavy hose. Or an unconscious person. His back has suffered serious creep, and it is in a terrible position to try to take on those loads. He \u201cthrows his back out\u201d\u2014way out. And he\u2019s apt to think that it was his strenuous movements that did it. Which, in a way, is true. But the real culprit was creep. And you do not have to sit in a fire station and then lift unconscious bodies to suffer from it. Sitting around the computer all day, followed by picking something slightly heavy off the floor, will do it. But for you as for the fireman, it was not the picking up that caused the pain. It was creep, and it happened over time. Creep can happen over a relatively short time, a long day at your desk. And it can really happen over extended periods of time. You \u201cdeform\u201d your back, and it is not ready or able to do what it was designed to do. \nSO WHAT DO YOU DO TO AVOID CREEP? \nAs I said, the best thing is to get up and move all the time, every twenty or thirty minutes. That\u2019s the short-term solution. In the longer term, you will want to do some serious exercises, too, to strengthen your core. And before that, you have to learn to use a neutral spine. That\u2019s really key, but we can\u2019t talk about everything at once. We\u2019ll get there soon. In the meantime, get moving. \nOther Trigger Behaviors \nOf course it is not just sedentary behavior that causes problems. Especially when combined with alternating patterns of idleness, like the behavior of that fireman. So don\u2019t just stop the idleness, stop the big triggering movements, too. Golf is a particular favorite. Let\u2019s assume, for a moment, that you lead a relatively sedentary life. Then you head out to the golf course and the basic movement is a wildly centrifugal twisting of your whole body\u2014especially your lower back\u2014as you swing for the fences. Is your back ready for that? No. Indeed, your lower back is never ready for that; it is not designed for that kind of torquing. You are going to have to learn to rotate much more with your hips, not your lower back. Don\u2018t worry, it works just about as well. \nWhat about snowmobiling? And tennis? And all the others? We\u2019re not going to go through them one at a time, because it\u2019s too complex for a single book. But we assume that the picture is clear. \nAnd it is not the entire sport or activity that causes problems; it\u2019s a few things. Think of weightlifting, for example. Weightlifting is great for you, and I hope you will do it forever. But most of us have not really learned to do it properly, and some of the things we do are disastrously bad. Think, for example, of the guy or gal you see at the gym, struggling with all their might to do bicep curls with very heavy dumbbells. If you look closely, you often see them tucking and bending their back in an attempt to lift the weights up, grunting and heaving all the way. This is disastrous for the spine. If you have to heave and move your back to lift a weight, it\u2019s too heavy. Using momentum by shoving your hips forward and bending your back is one of the worst things you can do for your lumbar spine. I could go on and on, but we cannot cover all of the terrible habits seen in the gym and sport at the very beginning. Better to get you to lay off all potentially harmful activities and get you back into them gradually, as you become wiser about how your back works. And doesn\u2019t work. \nSo, your life is not over. The fun stuff is not off-limits forever. It\u2019s just out of the picture for a bit while we teach you to move correctly. Then you can get back to virtually all the things on the list. But not this week. And maybe not for the next few months. You have to let your back heal. You have to learn some new behaviors. And you have to strengthen your core. Then it\u2019s back to your old activities with a new you. And they won\u2019t hurt anymore.",

        "prompt": "Please also read this CLASSIC FM ARTICLE ON PIECES WRITTEN FOR LEFT HAND:\n\nThe best classical music for piano left hand\n12 August 2014, 12:56 | Updated: 6 January 2017, 14:45\n\nFacebook share Twitter share\nIn celebration of International Left Handers Day, we're investigating the top ten pieces of piano music composed specifically for the left hand, as chosen by one-handed piano virtuoso, Nicholas McCarthy.\n\n1. Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Sa\u00ebns' left hand \u00e9tudes religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n\n\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n\n\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's \u00e9tudes - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate \u00e9tudes to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire \u00e9tude for left hand solo.\n\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n\n\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n\n\n7. Diversions - Britten\n\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n\n\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n\n9. Six \u00e9tudes for the left hand - Saint-Sa\u00ebns\n\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Sa\u00ebns' piano \u00e9tudes are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano.",

Could it be written any better? \n\nTo Whom It May Concern\nBankSA Credit Assessment Dept\nDear Sir/Madam,\nRE: Westpac Credit Card conduct\nI acknowledge that the conduct of my Westpac Credit Card has been less than satisfactory in the past.\nThis has been partly due to a hectic work schedule and general forgetfulness on my part. But for the most part, I went through a very stressful relationship breakdown over the past 2 years which preoccupied my train of thought. I was in a dispute with my ex and had to cope with a barrage of abuse and constant sniping from her and her family which, apart from sleepless nights, also caused me to have to involve police at one stage to deal with stalking and property damage issues.\nAt all times during this stressful period, I always prioritised my mortgage repayments and, as you can see, I have had a perfect repayment history on my ANZ Home Loan. Unfortunately, however, I often got wrapped up with the madness that was going on in my world and things like making my minimum payment on my Westpac Credit card were missed.\nThankfully, the situation in my personal life has recently resolved itself and, going forward, I am now able to concentrate much more clearly on all of my financial responsibilities, which I regard as extremely important going forward to maintain a good Credit rating.\nI can assure you I understand the importance of keeping on top of my loan reapyments and will take steps, as advised by my broker to have automatic payments established for my Credit cards so this situation never arises again, no matter what trauma I may face in my personal life.\nYour sincerely,\n\nDarrin Coudrey",

        "prompt": "you were writing your answer to this prompt: \"provide an updated version of the code that implements a deep reinforcement learning-based item recommendation system for Teamfight Tactics, incorporating some of the improvements discussed such as:Hyperparameter tuning: The hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate (epsilon) can be tuned to optimize the performance of the agent. A grid search or a random search could be used to find the optimal values.\n\nModel architecture: The DRLModel class defines the neural network architecture used by the DQN. However, the current architecture is quite simple and may not be optimal for playing Teamfight Tactics. A more complex and sophisticated architecture such as a convolutional neural network or a recurrent neural network could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nReplay memory: The current implementation uses a simple list as the replay memory. However, this can be quite inefficient and slow as the size of the memory grows. An efficient data structure such as a deque or a prioritized replay buffer could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nExploration strategy: The current implementation uses an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. However, this can be improved by using a more sophisticated exploration strategy such as Boltzmann exploration or the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.\n\nTransfer learning: The agent could potentially benefit from pretraining on a similar task or using the weights of a pre-trained model as a starting point. This could speed up the training process and improve the performance of the agent.\n\nModel evaluation: The code does not currently include any mechanism for evaluating the performance of the model.

It is required to be presented every time an individual acknowledges any document before a notary public; takes the oath of office upon election or appointment to any position in the government service; receives any license, certificate, or permit from any public authority; pays any tax or fees; receives any money from any public fund; transacts other official business; or receives any money from any public fund. \n\nEvery resident of legal age of the Municipality is required to secure this certificate yearly. The basic community tax fee is five pesos. If a person is working, an additional one peso for every 1,000 pesos of his gross annual income is added. This is secured during the first month of the year. If the Community Tax is not paid within the first quarter of the year, an interest is added to the basic fee. Income generated from this are usually added to finance local programs and projects of the Municipality. \n\nProcedures for securing a Community Tax Certificate\n\nApproach any personnel at the Office of the Municipal Treasurer. They will be the one to prepare for you your Community Tax Certificate (CTC).\n\nProvide data of the following:\nDate and Place of your birth\nSex, Civil Status, Weight and Height\nTax Identification Number (TIN)\nProfession/Occupation/Business\nPay the necessary payment for your Community Tax Certificate computed at P5.00 basic tax and additional P1.00 for every P1,000.00 gross receipts or earnings derived from business during the preceding year, additional P1.00 for every P1,000.00 salaries or gross receipt or earnings derived from exercise of profession or pursuit of any occupation and additional P1.00 for every P1,000.00 income from real property. Bear in mind that additional community tax shall not exceed P5,000.00. \n\nSign and affix your right thumb print on the space provided on your CTC.\n\nSecure the original copy of your Community Tax Certificate. analyze these steps in implementing the digital version of the community tax certificate and recommend novel and non-obvious systems and methods to the digital community certificate",

Others, however, believe that their positive impact on others is worth the money that they are paid.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no doubt that show business is an enormous and unfairly well paid sector. In addition to that, members of it do not add real value, compared to others like, for instance, education workers. Although in some countries teachers live with unreasonable wages, their responsibility, is extremely valuable for next generations become better people. Whereas a singer can earn double their yearly salary from one concert. The other important point is, for a balanced and equal society, the difference between income levels must not be very high. Regardless than their contribution, no one should make billions of dollars that easily, because that imbalance does have a significant negative impact on societies.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think that entertainers\u2019 contribution to the modern life is worth the money they earn. It can be understood that for many people, watching a movie or going to a concert is irreplaceable with other activities; therefore, they think that their positive impact is crucial for a significant proportion of people.

In exchange of that, they do deserve a comfortable life with significantly better paychecks.\n\nIn conclusion, despite their minimal contribution with their work to the people and sacrifice from their private life; I believe that their impact is far from being positive and they are not paid fairly or balanced with others.]",

Honestly bothers me how more people don\u2019t know about this app\nOff to a great start Still some things that can be added to improve the app but this is a great blend of functionality, ease of use, and visual display. Let me convert that week view to a pdf, give us a monthly view, and the ability to scroll in week view without shifting over to thebnext programed week start day (i\u2019d like to scroll over and view any lump of 7 days without it swiping all the way over to the next monday-friday.\nExactly what I was looking for! I really wanted a mashup of my calendar and reminders apps and this one is the perfect mix!!! I prefer entering items on my calendar (since I have many shared calendars with family) but also want to see them as I\u2019m looking at my to-do list for the day so the fact that this app imports my calendar while allowing me to add time blocks for each of my to-do items is fantastic. The drag + drop feature between lists and schedule makes planning my days so easy. I emailed the developer about a few small things I\u2019d love to see (the ability to choose different time durations for different events and the ability to add a note and just tap on it to see it) and he was very responsive and open to the feedback. I paid for the premium subscription and will gladly continue to subscribe to support development of an app that is just what I was hoping to find.\nBest Agenda ever for BUSY people This is the best app by far that I have seen that has the best time keeping agenda with the portion to color code, drag and pull, make recurring\u2026.and honestly I haven\u2019t even finished exploring it. It\u2019s pretty easy friendly\u2026I highly recommend this app for those people that are extremely busy and scatterbrained and have too much to do and hard to focus.\nAmazing The best app and one that keeps on improving!\nSo cool!!! I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before and I love it so much!! Really great for visualizing your schedule and moving it around easily.\nEnjoying this new app I just downloaded \"Would be better to have the whole month calendar to visualize monthly too. \nThank you\"\nSimple and a perfect fit! This app replaces perfectly the time management I was doing on paper every day. It provides just and only just what I need\u2026a list of tasks and a time based daily schedule. Things that I do everyday at the same time are permanent and repeatable each day, e.g. wake up and go to bed. While things that I do sporadically are in lists that I can drag and drop into my current day at times I have open from the daily routines I do each day, e.g. exercise. Premium adds some useful capabilities and is very affordable.\nLove it! I only wish it integrated with my Apple Watch. But I\u2019ve been looking for an app like this for years! Thank you!\n\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u4f5c\u8005 \u4f5c\u8005\u592a\u70ed\u5fc3\u4e86 \u8010\u5fc3\u7684\u5e2e\u6211\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898 \u7ec8\u4e8e\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165app\u4e86 \u518d\u5403\u611f\u8c22\u4f5c\u8005 \u8c22\u8c22 \u8c22\u8c22\nVery handy app This app was what I have been looking for. But it still needs some more tweaks. Hope it will be included in the coming updates.\nReally cool approach to planning Having a side by side view of my tasks and schedule is such an awesome way to dedicate time to actually getting things done. Great application!\nGreat Concept!! This app is great!! I have been looking for a long time to find an app that meets my needs. I love the capability of syncing my calendar and appointments (premium edition). I also love the task list and time blocking feature. This app has the ability to view both the task list and day schedule side by side and also allows you to drag and drop items from your task list to day schedule. This split view makes the process seamless, keeps everything organized in one place and eliminates the need for me to use paper lists. I am excited to see what other upgrades will be offered in the future. Looking forward to using this as my go-to scheduling app. Thank you!!!\nA simple and effective way of setting up your day \"Everything you need to organize your day is at your fingertips. \nAll you need is to KNOW what you want to do. \nBut if you know and want to take action, you can do worse than using this app, but not a lot better. \nReally the top of it\u2019s category.\"\nHow do I get out of dark mode?

Developer is very accommodating and very receptive to feedback. Worth a try!\nSo easy to use! \"I\u2019m 41 years old and always used paper to organize my day.I tried a few other apps but they didn\u2019t help like I thought. But this was so easy to use and having it on my phone is super helpful!\nHANDS DOWN the best organizer I have ever had!\"\n\ud83d\udd25 a very helpful timesaver \u23f0 \"This app has been super-helpful for me in making a daily schedule and budgeting my time \n\nIt easily integrates with whichever calendars I want it to, and is easy to use. There's a five minute video that explains the process, but it's not necessary because using the app is intuitive\n\nIt flawlessly syncs between my phone and my iPad. It's helped me immensely\n\nThe developer obviously cares and is very skilled. I'm looking forward to the eventual integrations with more apps, as well as with the Apple Watch\"\nWow! I have used sooo many time-planning apps, and none of them offered all of the features I need. TimeFinder is the only one that has met all of my needs for my constant creating, adjusting, changing, and LOVING of my schedule! While using this app, I found myself saying, \u201cCool!\u201d \u201cAwesome!\u201d and \u201cThis is perfect for me!\u201d\nBrilliant concept Love the concept of this app with an hourly schedule and the Split View is brilliant! I\u2019m going to try this app with my time management routine immediately!\nBest scheduling app I have found! I run a mobile crane service and use this app to schedule my appointments. The layout was exactly what I was looking for. I can break my schedule up into 30 min blocks and I\u2019ll put the company I am doing the work for on one line and then the job address in the other line. This gives me an easy visual reference of my schedule when customers are calling in to schedule jobs. I also love the note feature as well, which allows me to put in the details of the job, which is hidden away until I click on it, so as not to clutter up the visual representation of the schedule. I tried out several other apps but nothing fit my needs as perfectly as this one.\nYou\u2019ll wish you downloaded it sooner! TimeFinder is my favorite app of all time. I rave about it to everyone\u2014 this app is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity and efficiency. I highly recommend watching the tutorial\u2014 it\u2019s super user-friendly without it, but watching it helped me discover awesome features I didn\u2019t catch before. Stop reading and go download it. You won\u2019t be sorry!\nAwesome App Just what I was looking for!!\nLove this app I love that I can move stuff around easily. If I miss my time window it makes me conscious of all my time during the day. Great great tool.",

        "prompt": "Strategic Management Chapter 2.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\nCommunicating the Strategic Vision\nA strategic vision offers little value to the organization unless it\u2019s effectively commu-\nnicated down the line to lower-level managers and employees. A vision cannot provide direction for middle managers or inspire and energize employees unless everyone in the company is familiar with it and can observe senior management\u2019s commitment to the vision. It is particularly important for executives to provide a compelling ratio- nale for a dramatically new strategic vision and company direction. When company personnel don\u2019t understand or accept the need for redirecting organizational efforts, they are prone to resist change. Hence, explaining the basis for the new direction, addressing employee concerns head-on, calming fears, lifting spirits, and providing updates and progress reports as events unfold all become part of the task in mobilizing support for the vision and winning commitment to needed actions.\nWinning the support of organization members for the vision nearly always requires putting \u201cwhere we are going and why\u201d in writing, distributing the statement organiza- tionwide, and having top executives personally explain the vision and its rationale to as many people as feasible. Ideally, executives should present their vision for the company in a manner that reaches out and grabs people. An engaging and convincing strate- gic vision has enormous motivational value\u2014for the same reason that a stonemason is more inspired by the opportunity to build a great cathedral for the ages than a house. Thus, executive ability to paint a convincing and inspiring picture of a company\u2019s jour- ney to a future destination is an important element of effective strategic leadership.\n\nExpressing the Essence of the Vision in a Slogan The task of effectively con- veying the vision to company personnel is assisted when management can capture the vision of where to head in a catchy or easily remembered slogan. A number of organiza- tions have summed up their vision in a brief phrase. Instagram\u2019s vision is \u201cCapture and share the world\u2019s moments,\u201d while Charles Schwab\u2019s is simply \u201cHelping investors help themselves.\u201d Habitat for Humanity\u2019s aspirational vision is \u201cA world where everyone has a decent place to live.\u201d Even Scotland Yard has a catchy vision, which is to \u201cmake London the safest major city in the world.\u201d Creating a short slogan to illuminate an organization\u2019s direction and using it repeatedly as a reminder of \u201cwhere we are headed and why\u201d helps rally organization members to maintain their focus and hurdle whatever obstacles lie in the company\u2019s path.\n\nWhy a Sound, Well-Communicated Strategic Vision Matters A well-thought- out, forcefully communicated strategic vision pays off in several respects: (1) It crystal- lizes senior executives\u2019 own views about the firm\u2019s long-term direction; (2) it reduces the risk of rudderless decision making; (3) it is a tool for winning the support of orga- nization members to help make the vision a reality; (4) it provides a beacon for lower- level managers in setting departmental objectives and crafting departmental strategies that are in sync with the company\u2019s overall strategy; and (5) it helps an organization prepare for the future. When top executives are able to demonstrate significant prog- ress in achieving these five benefits, the first step in organizational direction setting has been successfully completed.",

        "prompt": "Organize the following text into a comprehensive report with categories and key ideas and knowledge shared by Charlie Munger:\n\nKey ideas and knowledge in the transcript excerpt:\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger have used leverage in the past to buy stocks under certain conditions.\nThis type of investment is called \"event arbitrage,\" \"liquidations,\" \"mergers,\" and is sometimes referred to as \"Jewish Treasury Bills\" by Ben Graham.\nBerkshire Hathaway has stock in Activision Blizzard, which can be considered a Jewish Treasury Bill.\nBuffett and Munger have used leverage in recent investments, such as in the Daily Journal Corporation and BYD.\nMunger suggests that younger individuals may need to follow the rules, but older individuals may know the exceptions based on their experience.\nThe excerpt is from a conversation where the speaker is discussing two topics - Jack Ma and Alibaba. Jack Ma, a major shareholder in Alibaba, gave a speech criticizing the Communist Party which caused him to vanish from public view for months. The speaker believes that Jack Ma acted stupidly by antagonizing the Chinese government, and it ended up hurting Alibaba. The speaker also discusses his own experience with Alibaba, stating that he considers it to be one of the worst mistakes he has ever made. He was charmed by the idea of Alibaba's position on the Chinese internet and did not realize that it is still a competitive retail business. The speaker thinks that the internet is not going to be an easy business for everyone.\nThe speaker suggests that the chances of a big confrontation with China have gone down due to what happened in Ukraine, and that the Chinese leader is smart and practical. The speaker believes that Taiwan is off the table in China for a long time, which he thinks helps the prospects of investors who invest in China. He argues that buying the best, stronger, better companies at a lower valuation in China is a good investment opportunity despite the extra risk involved. The speaker also mentions that he invested in China because of this reason and not because he preferred being in a foreign country. Finally, the speaker acknowledges that investing in his hometown would be more convenient but he can't find many investments there.\nThe speaker expresses optimism about the leader of the Chinese party, believing that he has done many things right, including leading an anti-corruption drive. The speaker also notes that no government in the world is perfect and that mistakes and misdecisions are a natural part of life. The speaker hopes to be surrounded by people who exercise good judgment, although they will not be right all the time.\nThe speaker expresses strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, referring to them as \"cryptocrap\" and \"cryptoshit\".\nHe believes that there are no good arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies, and that people who invest in them are making a dangerous and anti-social decision.\nThe speaker also criticizes governments that allow cryptocurrencies to exist, and praises the Chinese leader for banning them in China.\nHe sees national currencies as an essential part of human civilization, and believes that they have been crucial to the development of modern society.\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of making rational decisions and avoiding risky investments like cryptocurrencies.\nThe speaker is not currently short on any stocks or currencies.\nThe speaker has only made three short sales in their entire life, which were over 30 years ago.\nThe speaker made a big profit on one stock trade, but a big loss on the other, resulting in the trades cancelling out.\nThe speaker made a million-dollar profit on a currency bet but found the process unpleasant and did not want to do it again.\nThe speaker predicts that the culture of the world will become more anti-business in the big democracies.\nThe speaker believes that taxes will go up, not down.\nThe speaker thinks that it will get harder for everybody in the investment world, but that it has been almost too easy in the past for the investment class.\nThe speaker is not worried about these changes because they will not affect them personally, as they will be dead.\nThe speaker is discussing their personal habits and longevity. They mention that they are currently eating peanut brittle, which they jokingly claim is the key to living to be 99 years old. They also mention that they do not exercise much, except when required to do so by the Army Air Corps. Despite their lack of intentional exercise, they have managed to live to 99 years old.\nThe speaker uses a wheelchair to get around.\nDespite his limitations, he prefers old age to death.\nWhen he feels sad, he thinks about Roosevelt, who also used a wheelchair but still managed to lead the country for 12 years.\nInterest rates have gone up which is hostile to stock prices.\nIn investment life, there are headwinds and tailwinds to adapt to.\nOne of the headwinds is inflation which is unavoidable given the nature of democratic politics.\nMore inflation over the next 100 years is unavoidable.\nDaily Journal owns common stocks instead of government bonds because of this inflation.\nPoliticians in a democracy tend to be in favor of printing money and spending it which will cause some inflation over time.\nIt may avoid a few recessions, but it will do more harm than good from this point forward.\nBen Franklin was a genius who rose from absolute poverty to become the best inventor, scientist, writer, and diplomat in the United States during his time.\nHe was almost entirely self-educated and had a very high IQ.\nFranklin invented many things that we use today, such as bifocal glasses and the Franklin stove.\nHe was also a talented musician who played four different instruments.\nFranklin's contributions to his country were remarkable and the country was lucky to have him.\nWarren Buffett discusses his personal philosophy of delayed gratification and how it has contributed to his success in investing and in life. He emphasizes the importance of deferring gratification by investing in opportunities for long-term growth rather than seeking immediate returns. He also mentions his admiration for Benjamin Franklin and his many accomplishments as a writer, scientist, inventor, and diplomat. Additionally, he acknowledges the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on investment decisions, and he predicts that inflation will continue to be a challenge in the future due to political factors. Finally, he shares his current focus on buying and running apartment buildings as a way to defer gratification and seek long-term growth.\nPrivate property ownership leads to efficient decision-making and exchange, which results in a growing GDP per capita.\nCivilization has historically progressed from hunter-gathering to modern civilization through a system where most of the property was privately owned and there was freedom of exchange.\nThe education system often fails to teach basic economic principles such as the importance of private property ownership for economic growth.\nThe speaker was surprised by the number of people who die in the business world, and he compares it to the physical world where all animals and species eventually die to make way for new ones to thrive.\nHe mentions that even great companies like Kodak and Xerox eventually went out of business and lost their dominance, despite having the best technology and trademarks.\nThe speaker believes that almost everything in the business world dies on a large enough timescale, and that none of the acclaim lasts forever.\nHe suggests that understanding this concept has made him a better investor.\nJim Sinegal's success at Costco and his remarkable achievements in business, despite not having attended prestigious business schools.\nThe rarity of individuals like Jim Sinegal and Greg Able who possess a genius for handling people and solving problems, and running utilities efficiently.\nExamples of successful businesses such as TTI, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, that have been run by talented individuals who were fired from their previous jobs.\nThe admiration for individuals who prioritize running their businesses in the right way, even if it means not maximizing profits, such as Greg Able's approach to running utilities.\nThe value of having admirable business people involved in one's life.\nIt sounds like BYD was a standout investment for Berkshire, with a very high rate of return. It's interesting to hear that the investment in Ajit Jain, who has been a valuable employee at Berkshire, was also a great investment in terms of return on investment. It's clear that Berkshire has had some notable successes, but they don't happen all the time.",

        "prompt": "Title: \"Analysis of Hilbert transform and analytic signal - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \">> One of the transformations that sometimes used in some continuous time signals is Hilbert transform. It's not a big deal. This is just an example. Hilbert transform is an LTI filter, which has this unit [inaudible]. If I plot it, it's going to be hyperbola like that and so on. So it's not a causal filter, but it is a stable anti-causal. So this is -- because not causal, it is not implementable without delay. But you can approximately implement it in digital domain. So the Fourier transform of this particular LTI filter, this is just a normal LTI filter, becomes this function. And this is the sine function, which is equal to minus j for omega being positive and plus j for omega being negative. So is this function, if you calculate h of omega, magnitude of h of omega -- magnitude of this is one. Magnitude of this -- so this is equal one. So it has a constant magnitude. And positive frequencies are multiplied by plus j. And negative frequencies are multiplied by positive. So it's kind of like the sign for positive frequencies and negative frequencies are different. So it's kind of like this is the only difference. Now the output, this is called Hilbert transform of -- -- transform of x of t. Just LTI filter, simple LTI filter, which you can bond with this 1 over pi t. And it is given by this integral. So this is -- if input is WSS, the output is also wide-sense stationary. And in this example, because power spectral density of the input and output is just equal to -- you multiply these, this is equal to xx of omega times h of omega conjugate. And this guy is equal to conjugate of that, and this is what we get. Now if you calculate the power spectral density of the output, you shall multiply this one as xx of omega by h of omega to the power of 2. And for Hilbert transform, this is equal to 1. So the power spectral density of the input and output are identical. In some examples, like for instance for speech signals and so on, if this is a Hilbert transform of this -- so x of t -- so you convolve with this impulse response of 1 over pi t, you get this as output. Then we call these analytic signals. So that means that calculate -- for a real signal, calculate Hilbert transform. And another signal, when the real part is your signal, and then the imaginary part is your Hilbert transform, you call this z of ts analytic signal corresponding to x of t. So this z of t has a one to one relationship with x of t. And remember that Hilbert transform of Hilbert transform gives you a signal back. So [inaudible] the power spectral density of the analytic signal because you could see that this is equal to x of t convolved with 1 plus 1 over pi t. And then if you take Fourier transform of that, you get this one and then the magnitude of that. So the power spectral density of your analytic signal is interesting. So you get this. So what you see here is that power spectral density of z has a unit step function. So if you have -- x of t has a power spectral density here as xx of omega, z of t power spectral density will be zero at negative frequency. That means that using this Hilbert transform, you can eliminate these guys. And then here, you will have the same power spectral density but four times. That's it. So analytic signal and Hilbert transforms, you don't need to be scared. They're very simple.\"\nVideo Summary:",

ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.",

        "prompt": "Please translate the message below into Korean:\n\nIt looks like we are now over the worst of the weather thankfully. If you need support with getting time off or flexibility with work to deal with the impacts of the flooding, do get in touch.\n\nWith everything that is going on, collective bargaining probably hasn\u2019t been at the front of your mind. The team did want you all to have some additional information on their thinking on Academic and Professional Collective Bargaining. There has been much discussion in this bargaining round about two benefits that the Employer wants to remove from the employment agreements of future employees: the retirement gratuity (from Academic and Professional staff) and long service leave (from Professional staff). The Union strongly opposes this move, but the Employer continues to insist on it. It has become one of the main barriers to settlement.\n\nHere we attempt to provide some context about this element of the negotiations.\n\nThe Employer has given two reasons for wanting to remove these benefits. The first is financial, claiming that these benefits need to be removed to keep costs down. The second is purely ideological, claiming that they want to \"reward staff now\" and \"modernise\" the collective agreement, supposedly in the spirit of Taumata Teitei.\n\nThe financial argument holds no water. The Employer has said in bargaining that, over 10 years, cutting these benefits will save $20 million. While $20 million sounds a lot to those of us struggling to maintain a household, the figure needs to be put in the context of the University\u2019s overall budget. Over that same 10-year period, assuming 2% annual growth, the University will have revenue of $14.5 billion, so $20 million (i.e., $0.02 billion) represents just 0.14% (about 1/7 of 1%) of that budget. For further context, the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s annual salary is $755,000, so assuming a 2% annual increase, the cost of the VC\u2019s salary alone will be more than $8.4 million over that period.\n\nThe Employer has said that they \"value\" the removal of the benefits at 2% of our salaries, which is why their \u201cbest offer\u201d (with the removal of the benefits) is 2% higher over two years than their \u201calternative offer\" (without the removal of the benefits). Given that the University's annual salary bill is approximately $600 million, a 2% increase over 10 years would cost more than $120 million, or more than 6 times the projected savings of $20 million. The difference in these two figures indicates that the 2% \"value\" ascribed to the removal of the benefits is not financially justified. Any projected saving amounts to a tiny fraction of the overall budget and would have no discernible impact on the financial health of the University over the next decade. The University has the money to pay for the higher pay increase without removing retirement gratuity and long service leave from future staff members. \n\nSo, it is simply ideology that is driving the Employer\u2019s attempt to get us to sell out our future colleagues\u2019 benefits. Retirement and long-service benefits are designed to retain staff and reward service, and long-service benefits also to enable staff to take time off work to recharge (Ferris et al., 2015). Such benefits are standard throughout the sector - and much better in Australia and elsewhere (e.g., at ANU) - and claims for their removal have been dropped in negotiations at other universities. To say that such an ideology is in the spirit of Taumata Teitei is an egregious misreading of the strategy, which is grounded in the principles of manaakitanga (showing respect and caring for people) and whanaungatanga (fostering a sense of belonging through ongoing relationships between people). The Employer has seized on the current cost of living crisis that is affecting all staff at the University, particularly lower-paid staff, to force through this change.\n\nWe believe that you and your colleagues who will dedicate years and years of service - and overtime - to the University deserve recognition of that service. To this end, the bargaining team has attempted to negotiate alternative ways to recognise service during employment but has been rebuffed repeatedly by the Employer.\n\nWe hope that this explainer has provided some useful context and will help with what will likely be difficult decisions in coming weeks. The bargaining team knows that the choices we are all facing in the next few weeks are difficult, and we are prepared to stand by the will of the membership. We urge you, in considering the Employer\u2019s messages about the negotiations and pay offers, to remember not only the hard work of members that ensured that the University of Auckland didn\u2019t simply survive COVID but thrived as a scholarly voice in society, but also the solidarity of members during the industrial action in support of our claims in negotiations.",

America\u2019s partners will be activated by their own national-security concerns, as well as worry over China\u2019s record of copying technology, then driving out the original developers. But some of them will also have to free themselves from entrenched dependence on China, which will require time and consistent American policy to overcome.\n\nAgreements covering particular industrial sectors can be useful, involving not only tech but others, such as pharmaceuticals, as well. The approach involves strictly enforcing limits on Chinese participation in a supply chain serving the U.S. This same enforcement creates opportunities for firms to make gains in the American market as the subsidized Chinese competition is blocked. Some partners, with their own concerns about Chinese participation in supply chains, may not need much incentive.\n\nAn administration and Congress\u2014both motivated by unfair Chinese competition\u2014should be able to agree on pursuing such negotiations under the Trade Promotion Authority, through which Congress gives the president negotiation instructions in exchange for an up-or-down vote on any deal. If this occurs, the next step is to make the case to partners to partly replace the role played by China\u2019s large labor force; South Asian and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are well positioned to benefit.\n\nHow far and fast Xi\u2019s new economic strategy will go is debatable, but some signs of coercive economics are already apparent. In 2017, China blocked consumer products, travel, and cultural trade with South Korea because it deployed a U.S. anti-missile system (aimed at North Korea). In 2020, Beijing restricted trade with Australia as punishment for Canberra\u2019s desire to investigate COVID-19\u2019s origins. In late 2021, China began boycotting Lithuanian goods in response to the Baltic nation\u2019s establishing closer diplomatic ties with Taiwan. If unchallenged, China\u2019s bid on supply chains will further shift patterns of production and trade in its favor.\n\nChina is creating more enterprises like Huawei in semiconductors, biotechnology, and other industries. At some point, if Washington does something Beijing dislikes, China may simply stop the supply of crucial goods in these sectors. The nature of China\u2019s economic challenge has changed. America must adapt to meet it.\nTLDR;",

It involves various tasks that must be carried out throughout the project to ensure its success. These tasks include:\n\nObtaining necessary supplies.\nSelecting suppliers for the needed materials, negotiating prices if necessary, and ensuring timely delivery of supplies and equipment to the construction site are important tasks in contract administration.\n\nBest Practice: Creating a checklist of required materials and their respective suppliers, and including a timeline for delivery, can help ensure that all supplies are available when needed.\n\nChecking construction progress\nDuring the construction phase, it is important to regularly check if the builder and contractor are carrying out work as scheduled. This task involves monitoring the work progress and identifying any construction delays affecting the overall progress.\n\nBest Practice: Creating a project timeline with milestones, and regularly updating it to reflect changes or delays, can help ensure that the construction project stays on track.\n\nAddressing payment claims\nOrganising a payment schedule can help pay builders and contractors on time. Keeping track of payment claims that have been paid and those that are about to be paid can also help keep the budget in check.\n\nBest Practice: Creating a payment schedule and regularly updating it to reflect changes can help ensure that payments are made on time, and all parties involved are aware of the payment schedule.\n\nFixing Disputes\nIn case of a payment or building dispute, going back to the contract can help solve the problem. Contract administrators must step in to talk with the concerned parties before things escalate.\n\nBest Practice: Having a clear process for dispute resolution, including a designated point person, can help resolve disputes quickly and effectively.\n\nInstruction Reminders:\n\nEnsure to apply the relevant laws and legislation in Melbourne, Australia during the rewriting process and target to Home Owners as the persona.

        "prompt": "key points and figures, summary of: Family attitudes and beliefs\nHill & Franklin (Reference Hill and Franklin1998) among others have suggested that parents' overconcern with weight and dieting behaviour may be passed on to and adopted by their daughters. They conclude that mothers may have an important role in the transmission of cultural values regarding weight, shape and appearance. These authors cite the work of Pike & Rodin (Reference Pike and Rodin1991), who reported higher levels of disordered eating in the mothers of symptomatic 16-year-olds and suggested an \u201cagreed family agenda of weight concern, drive for thinness and dieting\u201d. Hill & Franklin (Reference Hill and Franklin1998) argue that research into parental promotion of weight concern rarely looks beyond maternal attitudes and behaviour. They suggest that this is primarily because of the presumed central role of mothers in acting out the nature and importance of thinness and to the gender-stereotyped nature of dieting itself. An earlier study from this team (Reference Hill and PallinHill & Pallin, 1995) had confirmed that maternal dieting was much more influential than paternal behaviour.\n\nClinically, however, comments from male family members are often cited as a precipitant for dieting (Reference Hill and PallinHill & Pallin, 1995), and Hill & Franklin (Reference Hill and Franklin1998) noted that subjects with high weight restraint were twice as likely as their non-restrictive controls to have male siblings. Thus the contribution of male family members to the development of weight and shape concerns should not be overlooked. Smolak et al (Reference Smolak, Levine and Schermer1999) have looked at the relative contribution of mothers' and fathers' direct comments about their child's weight and modelling of weight concerns through their own behaviour, on children's weight concerns and dieting. They found that direct comments \u2014 particularly by mothers \u2014 were more influential than modelling of behaviour. As in most studies, girls were more affected than boys. Daughters' concerns about fatness were related both to mothers' concerns with their own weight as well as concern about their daughter's weight. Daughters' concerns were also positively correlated with fathers' concerns about their own thinness.\n\nStriegel-Moore & Kearney-Cooke (Reference Striegel-Moore and Kearney-Cooke1994) have suggested that although parents are generally satisfied with their children's appearance, their negative comments increase with the child's age. Mothers may also be more concerned about the weight of their daughters than of their sons, particularly where the mother suffers with an eating disorder herself (Reference Agras, Hammer and McNicholasAgras et al, 1999).\n\nMothers of daughters with eating disorders have sometimes been found to have unusually high rates of disordered eating attitudes themselves. Pike & Rodin (Reference Pike and Rodin1991), for example, found the mothers had high scores using the Eating Disorder Inventory (Reference Garner and OlmstedGarner & Olmsted, 1983) and also felt their daughters should lose weight more often than did control mothers. Stein et al (Reference Stein, Stein and Walters1995) found that the mothers of younger children being treated for feeding disorders scored highly on nearly every sub-scale of the Eating Disorder Examination. They argue that these findings are consistent with the idea that maternal attitudes play a part in the process of the child acquiring psychopathology.",

This rough young Fletcher Gull was very nearly a perfect flight-student. He was strong and light and quick in the air, but far and away more important, he had a blazing drive to learn to fly. \n Here he came this minute, a blurred grey shape roaring out of a dive, flashing one hundred fifty miles per hour past his instructor. He pulled abruptly into another try at a sixteen-pint vertical slow roll, calling the points out loud. \n\"...eight ...nine ...ten ...see-Jonathan-I'm-running-out-of-airspeed ...eleven \n Fletcher's whipstall at the top was all the worse for his rage and fury at failing. He fell backward, tumbled, slammed savagely into and inverted spin, and recovered at last, panting, a hundred feet below his instructor's level. \n\"You're wasting your time with me, Jonathan! I'm too dumb! I'm too stupid! I try and try, but I'll never get it!\"\n Jonathan Seagull looked down at him and nodded. \"You'll certainly never get it as long as you make that pullup so hard. Fletcher, you lost forty miles an hour in the entry! You have to be smooth! Firm but smooth, remember?\"\n He dropped down to the level of the younger gull. \"Let's try it together now, in formation. And pay attention to that pullup. It's a smooth, easy entry\"\n By the end of three months Jonathan had six other students, Outcasts all, yet curious about this strange new idea of flight for the joy of flying. \n Still, it was easier for them to practice high performance than it was to understand the reason behind it. \n\"Each of us is in truth an idea of the Great Gull, and unlimited idea of freedom,\" Jonathan would stay in the evenings on the beach, \"and precision flying is a step toward expressing our real nature. Everything that limits us where we have to put aside. That's why all this high-speed practice, and low-speed and aerobatics...\"\n ...and his students would be asleep, exhausted from the day's flying. They liked the practice, because it was fast and exciting and it fed a hunger for learning that grew with every lesson. But not one of them, not even Fletcher Lynd Gull, had come to believe that the flight of ideas could possibly be as real as this flight of wind and feather. \n\"Your whole body, from wingtip to wingtip,\" Jonathan would say, other times, \"is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see. Break the chains of your thought, and you break the chains of your body, too . . .\" But no matter how he said it, it sounded like pleasant fiction, and they needed more to sleep. \nIt was only a month later that Jonathan said the time had come to return to the Flock. \n\"We're not ready!\" said Henry Calvin Gull. \"We're not welcome! We're \n\"We're free to go where we wish and to be what we are,\" Jonathan answered, and he lifted from the sand and turned east, toward the home grounds of the Flock. \n There was a brief anguish among his students, for it is the Law of the Flock that an Outcast never returns, and the Law had not been broken once in ten thousand years. The Law said stay; Jonathan said go; and by now he was a mile across the water. If they waited much longer, he would reach a hostile Flock alone. \n\"Well, we don't have to obey the law if we're not a part of the Flock, do we?\" Fletcher said, rather self-consciously. \"Besides, if there's a fight, we'll be a lot more help there than here.\"\n And so they flew in from the west that morning, eight of them in a double-diamond formation, wingtips almost overlapping. They came across the Flock's Council Beach at a hundred thirty-five miles per hour, Jonathan in the lead, Fletcher smoothly at hi right wing, Henry Calvin struggling gamely at his left. Then the whole formation rolled slowly to the right, as one bird ... level ... to ... inverted ... to ... level, the wind whipping over them all. \n The squawks and grackles of everyday life in the Flock were cut off as though the formation were a giant knife, and eight thousand gull-eyes watched, without a single blink. One by one, each of the eight birds pulled sharply upward into a landing on the sand. Then as though this sort of thing happened every day, Jonathan Seagull began his critique of the flight. \n\"To begin with,\" he said with a wry smile, \"you were all a bit late on the join-up . . .\" \nIt went like lightning through the Flock. Those birds are Outcast! And they have returned! And that . . . that can't happen! Fletcher's predictions of battle melted in the Flock's confusion. \n\"Well, O.K., they may be Outcast,\" said some of the younger gulls, \"but where on earth did they learn to fly like that?\" \nIt took almost an hour for the Word of the Elder to pass through the Flock: Ignore them. The gull who speaks to an Outcast is himself Outcast. The gull who looks upon an Outcast breaks the Law of the Flock. \n Grey-feathered backs were turned upon Jonathan from that moment onward, but he didn't appear to notice. He held his practice sessions directly over the Council Beach and for the first time began pressing his students to the \n\"Martin Gull!\" he shouted across the sky. \"You say you know low-speed flying. You know nothing till you prove it! FLY!\"\n So quiet little Martin William Seagull, startled to be caught under his instructor's fire, surprised himself and became a wizard of low speeds. In the lightest breeze he could curve his feathers to lift himself without a single flap of wing from sand to cloud and down again. \nLikewise Charles-Roland Gull flew the Great Mountain Wind to twenty-four thousand feet, came down blue from the cold thin air, amazed and happy, determined to go still higher tomorrow. \n Fletcher Seagull, who loved aerobatics like no one else, conquered his sixteen-point vertical slow roll and the next day topped it off with a triple cartwheel, his feathers flashing white sunlight to a beach from which more than one furtive eye watched. \n Every hour Jonathan was there at the side of each of his students, demonstrating, suggesting, pressuring, guiding. He flew with them through night and cloud and storm, for the sport of it, while the Flock huddled miserably on the ground.\n When the flying was done, the students relaxed on the sand, and in time they listened more closely to Jonathan. He had some crazy ideas that they couldn\u2019t understand, but then he had some good ones that they could. \n Gradually, in the night, another circle formed around the circle of students \n-a circle of curious gulls listening in the darkness for hours on end, not wishing to see or be seen of one another, fading away before daybreak. \nIt was a month after the Return that the first gull of the Flock crossed the line and asked to learn how to fly. In his asking, Terrence Lowell Gull became a condemned bird, labelled Outcast; and the eighth of Jonathan's students. \n The next night from the Flock kame Kirk Maynard Gull, wobbling across the sand, dragging his left wing, to collapse at Jonathan's feet. \"Help me,\" he said very quietly, speaking in the way that the dying speak. \"I want to fly more than anything else in the world . . . \" \n\"Come along then,\" said Jonathan. \"Climb with me away from the ground, and we'll begin\" \n\"You don't understand. My wing. I can't move my wing.\" \n\"Maynard Gull, you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way. It is the Law of the Great Gull, the Law that Is.\" \n\"Are you saying I can fly?\" \n\"I say you are free.\"",

This writer is clearly a curious and intellectual person. The questions they ask in the first part of the essay (\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the wings function like a bird\u2019s wings? Why did hitting something soft break my frame? Why hadn\u2019t the parachutes deployed correctly? Above all, why didn\u2019t I fly?\u201d) highlight that. In your essay, don\u2019t shy away from asking tough questions. In the end, the author still hasn\u2019t achieved human flight, but you can clearly see how his interest in the whys of life has propelled him to take on new engineering problems. Sometimes, you don\u2019t need to answer the questions you pose for them to serve a purpose in your essay.\n\nIt returns back to where it started. There\u2019s something satisfying about returning to your intro in your conclusion. In this case, the author comes back to his first flying experience and re-evaluates what the experience means to him now as well as how his thinking has evolved. Think of your essay as a circle (or maybe a blob depending on what you\u2019re writing about). Your end should loop back to where you started after your narrative arc is mostly complete.\n\nUses specific jargon (but not too much). We might not know what a \u201cpiezoresistive microcantilever\u201d is or how it relates to \u201cbeta-amyloid proteins,\u201d but that\u2019s not really the point of including it in this essay. By using these terms the author signals to us that he knows what he\u2019s talking about and has a degree of expertise in engineering.

        "prompt": "From the following information, write a a similar document, but better worded and more concise. \n\nPlaces to Put a Titan Balance Assist Titan pole for the Elderly\nA Titan pole is helpful for individuals after surgery, acute illness, physical injury or those with chronic health conditions that affect their strength, balance and endurance. This home safety equipment is especially helpful for frail elderly that are more prone to falls and deconditioning following a hospital stay.\nTitan Balance Assist Titan poles for the elderly are usually found in these three places within the home:\n1. Bathroom \u2013 useful for safely getting in or out of the bathtub or shower.\nBathing and showering is an activity that can be challenging for some individuals, particularly those that are recovering from surgery, have a recent hospital stay or any significant disability. \n\nBUY AT AMAZON\nThese individuals may benefit from having a Titan pole to grab onto for support with stepping into or out of the shower or bathtub. With a security Titan pole, a grab handle can be within reach to steady someone while they are standing to have a shower, or be used for help with standing up from a shower stool.\nFurthermore, the Titan pole can be positioned near the toilet to help with slowly sitting down or standing up from the toilet seat.\n2. Bedroom \u2013 great for repositioning one\u2019s body within bed and using it for support to lift oneself out of bed.\nMany beds are low which can make standing up challenging. Furthermore, mattresses often have some give to them that cause them to sink slightly under someone\u2019s body weight. Together these two factors make standing up harder, especially if one has any form of weakness in their legs.\n\nBUY AT AMAZON\nWith a floor to ceiling Titan pole positioned at the bedside, an individual can grab it to help pull themselves up from bed and steady themselves as they walk away, start to use a gait aid or transfer to a wheelchair for mobility assistance.\n3. Living Room \u2013 helpful for moving into a chair or couch and for assistance with standing up.\nAnother room to place a transfer Titan pole is within the living room. In this room, it can be used to help someone reposition within their favorite chair or couch. It can also be used to assist with lowering themselves into the seat or help with rising out of it.\nA security Titan pole is usually used by seniors that wish to age in place and live independently on their own with less support from family or private caregivers. Given that the living room is often a main living space for many, a supportive bar to help with standing and balance can be useful when no one else is around to provide assistance.\nImportant considerations when installing a floor to ceiling Titan pole\nEach home has a different layout and every individual has their own capabilities. In order to successfully install and safely use a floor mounted ceiling Titan pole, some certain conditions must be met:\n1. Height of the room must not be too tall \u2013 the ceiling must be 9 feet high or lower when installing most Titan poles.\nWhile tension mounted floor to ceiling Titan poles are height adjustable to fit rooms with varying sizes, the maximum ceiling height capable of accommodating this equipment is generally 9 feet tall. \nAnything beyond this height would either require a Titan pole extension to be used to lengthen the bar even further, or to utilize an alternative standing aid to support someone with balance and getting up from a seat.\n2. Need good upper body strength for pulling \u2013 sufficient grasping and upper arm strength is required to use the Titan pole.\nThis equipment does not do the work for you, rather it helps to offload some of the strength required to stand into other parts of your body to assist with the movement. If someone has a slight to moderate amount of weakness in their torso or legs, they may be able to continue to stand up on their own by grabbing this Titan pole for support and pulling themselves up. \nHowever, if someone is incapacitated or physically disabled to the point where they require assistance from two or more caregivers with standing, an alternate supportive aid may need to be considered. \n3. Must be able to weight bear through the legs \u2013 one must be able to stand for short periods of time if using this equipment.\nIn order to use this equipment, one must be able to bear weight through their legs while transferring onto another nearby surface or seat. If someone were to have no ability to place weight through their lower body, they would drop to the floor the very instance they stand up and try to rely on their legs for balance.\n4. Clearance needed around the Titan pole \u2013 there must be enough room to safely maneuver around the Titan pole.\nIn order to move to another surface or start using a mobility device, there should be enough clearance around the Titan pole. This can be particularly challenging because the Titan pole itself must also be within reach of the bed, bath/shower or preferred chair as having a Titan pole in the centre of the room with nothing around it serves no purpose.\nThus, when considering the layout of one\u2019s living space, a floor to ceiling Titan pole can start to make the room feel crowded and busy relatively quickly. Careful thought must be placed in regards to its location as the bar itself can interfere with walking or positioning a wheelchair near the equipment.\n5. Regular maintenance must be performed \u2013 check the equipment regularly to ensure it remains sturdy and well secured in place.\nFor any medical equipment, safety measures must be taken to ensure the device is in good working order. For a security Titan pole, this means that the mechanism must be checked for appropriate tension to ensure that it is able to bear someone\u2019s weight during any transfer attempt. \nAs well, the equipment must be wiped down regularly of any moisture or water exposure to ensure that the material does not rust or degrade overtime. This is especially for Titan poles that are situated within the bathroom where surfaces may get wet more easily.\n6. Titan pole users must have intact cognition \u2013 must have the capacity to understand how to safely utilize the equipment to facilitate a transfer.\nIn order to safely use a floor to ceiling transfer Titan pole and not sustain a fall during a transfer attempt, one must understand the steps that need to be taken during any movement with the Titan pole\u2019s support.\nFor example, someone that has impaired thinking or rationalization skills may not follow appropriate transfer mechanics. This could make getting out of bed, or the shower more difficult and potentially dangerous if someone does not have insight into their own physical abilities or understand how they should position their body to safely get up.\nIt is well known that cognition can fluctuate throughout the day depending on one\u2019s energy levels, nutritional intake, and pain levels. So it is important that a cognitive assessment be completed to determine safety with using transfer aids. In most cases, a physician, or an allied rehab therapist trained on basic home safety and medical equipment can help determine if one is safe to use a floor to ceiling Titan pole.",

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nCommon misconceptions about defects liability periods\n\nIt is important for both the principal and the construction contractor to be aware that under Australian law, the expiry of a defects liability period does necessarily mean that the construction contractor\u2019s obligation with regard to the works also comes to an end.\n\nA defects liability period creates a contractual obligation under which the construction contractor is required to return to the site and rectify any defects identified in the works it has performed. However, the principal may still have a right at common law to pursue the construction contractor for damages for breach of contract if any defects in the works transpire.\n\nThe period of time that the principal has to make a claim at common law for damages will depend on whether the construction contract is executed as a deed or an agreement and applicable state legislation. If the construction contract is executed a deed, the principal will have up to 12 years from the date the defect occurs to bring a claim for damages against the construction contractor. If the construction contract is executed as an agreement, this period is up to 6 years.\n\nA second misconception occasionally affects international parties that are less familiar with common law legal concepts as they apply in Australia. The standard remedy under common law for defects in the works is a claim in damages. Specific performance of a construction contract (namely defect rectification) may not be granted by the courts, unless exceptional circumstances apply. Providing for defects rectification is critical in common law-based construction contracts to create a period during which the principal is entitled to require defects rectification and the construction contractor is given an opportunity to rectify.",

(II) Teachers can help reduce unrealistic fears\nby pointing out how common they are among people\nand what to do about them in order to reduce such fears\nby providing opportunities for students to practice alone\nor with one other student and then before increasingly\nlarger groups. (III) Thus, students can practice speaking\nin front of their peers who face the same situation\nwhile presenting information, answering questions and\nholding group discussions. (IV) Students need to know\nhow speakers differ from one another and how particular\ncircumstances call for different forms of speech.\n(V) Practising oral presentation in these ways can lessen\nstudents\u2019 anxieties while, at the same time, helping\nthem to learn the subject matter of the lesson.\n\nA)I B)II C)III D)IV E)V\n77.(I) Whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, are the biggest fish\non Earth, reaching up to 20 metres long and\nweighing up to 20 tonnes. (II) Despite their size, the\nslow-moving giants are not dangerous to humans.\n(III) Whale sharks tend to cluster at various coastal\nareas, drawn by seasonal increases in prey, including\nzooplankton blooms and fish spawning. (IV) Juveniles\nhave been known to play with divers. (V) But humans\nare a threat to them, with the species considered\nendangered as numbers decline from fishing, accidental\ncapture alongside other fish, and collisions with vessels.\n\nA)I B)II C)III D)IV E)V\n78.(I) All human muscles contain both slow and fast fibres,\nbut muscles differ in the percentage of each. (II) The\npercentage of each fibre type in a particular muscle also\nvaries from person to person. (III) For example, in the\nquadriceps muscles of the legs, most marathon runners\nhave about 80% slow fibres, whereas sprinters have\nabout 60% fast fibres. (IV) It is unusual to find a runner\nwho competes equally well in both 100-m and 10,000-m\nraces; runners just seem to feel comfortable running\nraces of particular lengths. (V) These differences, which\nare genetically determined, undoubtedly help account\nfor our differing athletic capabilities.\nA)I B)II C)III D)IV E)V\n79.(I) The Aztecs, who developed a great but short-lived\ncivilisation in central Mexico, are descendants of a\nwarlike tribe known as the Toltecs. (II) According to the\nAztecs, their original homeland was an island in a lake\ncalled Aztlan, which means 'White Land'. (III) In the 10th\ncentury AD, the Toltecs built a great city called Tula to\nthe north of what is now Mexico City. (IV) But only two\nand a half centuries later, in the middle of the 12th\ncentury, the Toltecs were conquered by a nomadic tribe\ncalled the Chicimeca.

        "prompt": "You made a mistake. Xiao (Chinese: \u9b48 Xi\u0101o) is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact.\n\nHe is an adeptus, under the name Alatus, and the sole surviving member of the five foremost Yakshas dispatched by Morax to subdue the demonic spirits that plagued Liyue. He currently resides at Wangshu Inn and mostly restrains himself from large crowds and social interactions. \n\nXiao has dark medium-length hair with teal undertones, which is swept back in front of his ears. He has two longer locks that frame his face. He has pale skin and golden irises with avian pupils, and dons red eyeshadow similarly to Zhongli and Cloud Retainer. Xiao also has a purple diamond marking on his forehead, and a green tattoo around his right arm.\n\nXiao wears a white sleeveless shirt with subtle cloud patterns. It has a high black collar with golden accents, with its left side extending further to cover his shoulder. He wears baggy dark purple pants, and wears dark purple boots overtop. Xiao has black and dark turquoise gloves with gold decals and a necklace. Around his left arm, Xiao wears a white and gold sleeve with a red lining. He notably carries an Anemo vision on his left glove and is usually seen carrying his Yaksha mask on the back of his right hip.\n\nXiao's avian illuminated beast form has been teased in his character design, his constellation, and his yaksha alias Alatus. It is implied that he takes on the form of Garuda, a Hindu demigod, or Peng (can be seen in the Chinese translation of Alatus: \u91d1\u9e4f J\u012bnp\u00e9ng), a creature present in both Chinese and Buddhist mythos. Xiao has been called the 'Golden-Winged King,' which may be another reference to the Golden-Winged Great Peng, a guardian deity in Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nIn some lines of Genshin Impact merchandise, stylized depictions of Xiao's avian form has been shown. The bird form appears to be a finch-like, though this is inconclusive due to stylization. Its plumage features multiple shades of teal, reddish eyes and Xiao's purple diamond symbol on its forehead. \n\nXiao is a yaksha who has fought in the Archon War and holds a high level of seniority among adepti. He has a reserved demeanor and has little intention of getting close to mortals. He does not want sympathy for his past and believes his fellow Yakshas would also find it insulting.[2]\n\nHe is immensely grateful to Morax for saving him, dedicating his life to protecting Liyue as payment. He does not take lightly to those who speak ill of the Geo Archon regardless of whoever they are.[3] Despite suffering from constant karmic debt, Xiao is highly resilient towards its alluring corruption, as his fellow yaksha have either succumbed or died to it. Due to this debt, he prefers being alone and rarely involves himself in mortal affairs; in the few times he does have to, he asks they get to the point for their own sake.\n\nXiao is unfamiliar with many human customs and societal norms, often finding them strange, childish, or pointless. To others, he can come off as distant and intimidating. After meeting the Traveler, he becomes slightly more relaxed, willing to learn customs and visit Liyue Harbor with them for their sake despite his reservations with mortal life.[4][5] He is also revealed to be a strict yet effective teacher when acting as a mentor figure for Ganyu, but he believes that as a soul-slaughtering yaksha, he is not a suitable teacher for her.[6]\n\nUnlike most of the adepti, Xiao is not particularly fond of most human foods, although he makes exceptions to Almond Tofu and later Grilled Tiger Fish, the former reminding him of the dreams he used to consume and the latter to honor Pervases' memory.",

Keep the level of formality.\n\nDear Councilmember [Name],\n\nI would like to add my support as a constituent in [Neighborhood] to a bill that was recently introduced, # Int 0501-2022. This bill would help in the enforcement of blocked bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, which any pedestrian or biker in NYC knows is a massive problem. Blocked lanes and sidewalks are a contributing factor to our deadly traffic problem, forcing bikers and pedestrians into traffic and creating an inconvenience and hazard to everyone else.\n\nI like this bill because it builds off the success of the idling commercial truck laws, which allow citizens to report violations \u2014 adding actual consequences to breaking the law and providing an additional revenue stream for the city.\n\nTypically, when we report bike lane blockages via 311, the police response is non-existent and therefore enforcement is non-existent. Many people feel free to use the bike lanes as their personal parking space, and they take advantage of that to the fullest. Allowing citizens to report these blockages directly would show the people of NYC that they can't simply block these lanes and sidewalks without a fine, at a minimum. It would also bring in an underutilized source of revenue for the city at no real additional cost.\n\nIn asking for your support of this bill I would also ask that while the bill is in committee the language is updated to remove the 1320-foot school proximity requirement so that it can be enforced citywide.\n\nI hope we can count on your support for this bill!\n\nThanks, [Name]",

        "prompt": "Rewrite this article exactly 3000 words and Insert the subheadings In this article, we will delve into the efforts of an Arizona State University (ASU) professor who has used tracking technology to conserve shark birthing areas. Sharks are often seen as menacing creatures, but the reality is that humans are more of a threat to them. Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting threatened species, reports that 75% of shark species are at risk of extinction, and up to 73 million sharks are killed annually for their fins. As a result, habitats that once served as safe areas for sharks to give birth have been affected. Given that sharks have long gestation periods, produce a limited number of young, and mature late in life, repopulating them is challenging. Sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ocean ecosystem, and their survival is vital to the planet and its inhabitants.\n\nProfessor James Sulikowski, who has studied sharks for almost three decades, runs the Sulikowski Shark and Fish Conservation Lab at ASU's School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences. He has appeared on numerous television shows, including the Today show, Ocean Mysteries, NatGeo, and the Discovery Channel. He acknowledges that safeguarding newborn shark pups would help reverse the current trend. Consequently, Sulikowski has researched and aided in the development of a groundbreaking satellite technology that documents the time and location of birth of shark pups from afar. This data enables the scientific community to devise ways to safeguard the sharks' vulnerable birthing grounds.\n\nSulikowski's device has garnered attention and acclaim within the scientific community. Sulikowski and his partner, Neil Hammerschlag, a marine ecologist at the University of Miami, outlined the deployment and results of an intrauterine satellite tag on two highly mobile sharks in a paper released on March 1 in Science Advances. These sharks were a scalloped hammerhead and a tiger shark, and the tag was a birth-alert tag (BAT). The BAT is egg-shaped and inserted into a pregnant shark. The technology is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. Once the shark gives birth, the BAT pops out along with the pups and floats to the ocean's surface. The device then switches to transmitter mode, sending messages about the birth's location and time.\n\nThe BAT has already yielded remarkable results. It was previously thought that sand sharks gave birth inland, but the scientists discovered that they prefer abandoned shipwrecks on the ocean floor. For many shark species, it is unknown where they give birth or how far they must travel to habitats that are essential for their survival. By identifying these habitats, conservation efforts can be made, such as creating sanctuaries or expanding areas already designated for this purpose.\n\nSulikowski intends to take the BAT global, creating a network of shark scientists worldwide to determine areas that are significant to sharks and how to protect them.\n\nThe BAT has drawn a lot of attention, with an episode about Sulikowski's research airing during Shark Week on the Discovery Channel in July. However, the development of the BAT has been a long and challenging process. It took Sulikowski and Hammerschlag over six years to create the technology, and there were numerous failures along the way, such as battery, firmware, and antenna malfunctions. There were times when they waited six, seven, or eight months without receiving any data, leading Sulikowski to feel like giving up multiple times. Nevertheless, they persevered, and Sulikowski feels proud to have created technology that will revolutionize the study of sharks.\n\nThe conservation of shark birthing areas is crucial for the survival of many species. The use of the BAT has provided valuable data that can be used to protect threatened and endangered shark species. Sulikowski's innovative technology may pave the way for more effective conservation efforts for sharks, particularly those that rely on specific birthing habitats. By understanding where these habitats are located and the movement patterns of pregnant female sharks, conservationists can develop targeted protection plans to ensure the survival of these vulnerable populations.\n\nThe use of technology, such as the BAT, can also help to identify areas where human activities, such as fishing or development, may be having a negative impact on shark populations. By identifying and mitigating these threats, conservationists can work to ensure that these habitats remain intact and that shark populations can thrive.\n\nOverall, the conservation of shark birthing areas is crucial for the long-term survival of these magnificent creatures. Through the use of innovative technologies and targeted conservation efforts, we can work to protect these important habitats and ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the beauty and diversity of the world's oceans.",

Some have held the\nview that humans are exceptional in these respects,\nwhile others believe that humans and animals are\nsimilar with respect to language and thought. The issue\nis important because our self-image as a species is at\nstake. Arguments for human exceptionalism such as\nCartesian, Wittgensteinian and behaviourist state that\nlanguage and thought are closely associated, and\nanimals do not have language. The ape language\nexperiments of the 1960s and 1970s were especially\nimportant against this background: if apes could learn\nlanguage then even the advocates of human\nexceptionalism would have to admit that they have\nthoughts. It is now generally believed that whatever\nlinguistic abilities apes have shown have been quite\nrudimentary. Yet many sceptics are willing to grant that\nin some cases apes did develop linguistic skills to some\nextent, and clearly evidenced thought. Studies of other\nanimals in captivity and various animals in the wild have\nprovided evidence of highly sophisticated\ncommunicative behaviour. Cognitive ethology and\ncomparative psychology have emerged as the fields that\nstudy animal thought. While there are conceptual\ndifficulties in grounding these fields, it appears plausible\nthat many animals have thoughts and these can be\nscientifically investigated.\n\n43.According to the passage, the issue of animal\nlanguage is significant because ----.\n\nA)it has just started to emerge in various debates\n\nB)it can determine the self-image of human beings as a\nspecies\n\nC)it has been proven that animals can understand\nhuman language\n\nD)human beings\u2019 self-image is strengthened when\nanimals understand their language\n\nE)there is strong evidence against animals\u2019 ability to\nhave thoughts\n44.According to the passage, human exceptionalism is\nbased on ----.\n\nA)evidence that apes have the ability to learn a human language\n\nB)the fact that apes are able to think just like humans do\n\nC)the assumption that animal behaviour is closely\n\nD)connected to their thoughts\nan idea that there is a strong link between language\nand thought\n\nE)a behaviourist approach to language learning\n\n45.It can be inferred from the passage that ----.\n\nA)captive and wild animals differ greatly in how they\ncommunicate\n\nB)wild animals are better at developing ways of\ncommunication than captive animals\n\nC)there is a significant lack of study of animal thought\nand communication\n\nD)studies of animals in captivity fail to provide any\nevidence of their ability to think\n\nE)whether captive or wild, many animals may exhibit\nsophisticated communicational behaviour\n\n46.Which of the following can be said about the author\nof the passage?\n\nA)He seems to be of the opinion that there are many\nanimals with the ability to think.\n\nB)He supports the philosophical views that regard\nhumans as the highest of species.\n\nC)He clearly states that investigating animal intelligence\nin terms of thinking is a waste of time.\n\nD)He does not accept the idea that humans and animals\ncan be investigated on one scale.\n\nE)He endorses the idea that human beings\u2019 self-image\nas a species has been destroyed.",

New evidence suggests that\nour initially weak memories are maintained by the brain\nfor a set period of time, during which they can be\nenhanced. In a recent study, psychologists at New York\nUniversity showed 119 participants a set of images of\ntools and animals. A few minutes later the subjects saw\na new set of images, with an electric shock paired with\neither tools or animals to increase the salience of\none category. The participants' memories for both sets\nof images were then tested either six hours later, or the\nnext day. Participants remembered images from the first\nseries better if they belonged to the same category that\nwas later paired with a shock.

By creating a global, community-based food system, Fresh Earth empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume. The system is designed to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem. By incentivizing participation and engagement, the Fresh Earth token driven system acts as an impact generation machine at scale, driving participation, investment, and the transition to regenerative practices.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is composed of several key components that intermesh to drive participation, investment and the transition to regenerative practices. These include:\n\nFresh Earth Token: At the heart of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a powerful tool that represents fractional ownership of the food ecosystem business, serving as a store of value that can be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, retaining its value and purchasing power over time. It leverages the future impact of regenerative projects to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading, and ESG investors. it also drives the rewards system, incentivizing participation and engagement of stakeholders within the ecosystem, including farmers, consumers, and investors, towards the common goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices.\u00a0 \n\nValidation System: Based on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density, this is a science-driven approach to measuring and validating the impact outcomes of regenerative practices and projects. It uses an open-source sandbox environment for data access and analytics, providing transparency and accountability for stakeholders. The immense amount of data gathered over time will be a monetizable value to a world in transition.\n\nB2B Marketplace: A digital platform connects farmers on the regenerative pathway with businesses, reducing costs and risks for farms and allowing businesses to access verified, locally developed regenerative food products directly from the designers, manufacturers, and producers.\n\nB2C Marketplace: A platform that encourages innovation and collaboration among stakeholders in the food ecosystem, featuring a wide range of food products and services informed by consumer demand and fostered by the workflows and collaborations on all Fresh Earth platforms.\n\nDigital Collaborative Community: A professional network of experts and stakeholders who contribute to the development and validation of regenerative systems, providing tools to collaborate around projects and simplify the validation process.\n\nRewards System: This component Incentivizes participation and engagement within the ecosystem by rewards stakeholders for their contributions that recognizes the value of their participation, promoting transparency and decentralization in the management of the food ecosystem business.\n\nThese components work together to create a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe sophisticated tech platform is designed so that the Ecosystem operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that facilitates the food ecosystem business. \n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a digital organization that is run by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain network. The rules and governance of a DAO are determined by its token holders, who have ownership over the organization through their possession of the organization's native token. Transactions and decisions within a DAO are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability. DAOs are often created to manage decentralized projects or communities, and can operate without the need for a central authority or intermediary.Logic of Fresh Earth and the Token.\n\nThis structure allows investors to participate in the growth and success of the ecosystem and share in the value generated. To facilitate efficiency the Fresh Earth DAO includes multi-tiered governance and decision-making, with a board of directors, advisory board, and a voting system for major decisions, as well as systems for transparently tracking and reporting the use of funds and the impact of the ecosystem to provide added security and accountability for the investors.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is a perfect example of how tokenization can be used to create a more equitable and sustainable world, with the power to drive real change and make a positive impact on the planet and society. It's unique combination of token archetypes, underlying value and network value, makes it a strong and adaptable mechanism for promoting the growth and success of the regenerative agriculture ecosystem.",

        "prompt": "David J. Collis goes on to say\nThe Incumbent\u2019s Mistake\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms\u2019 activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovator?\n\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you\u2019ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn\u2019t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn\u2019t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn\u2019t exist previously.\n\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn\u2019t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\n\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects\u2019 entire costs by well over 15%\u2014creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu\u2019s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\n\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model\u2014that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\n\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix\u2019s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster\u2019s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was \u201cdelivering personal video entertainment,\u201d suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider\u2014convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog\u2014reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren\u2019t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it\u2019s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\n\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores. Source: Author analysis, \u201cNetflix in 20 11,\u201d an HBS case study by Willy Shih and Stephen P. Kaufman\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon\u2019s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart\u2019s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon\u2019s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart\u2019s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart\u2019s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon\u2019s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other\u2019s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers.",

        "prompt": "now write me the methods section that includes all the following information:\nVarious small theoretical studies were made to have a more insight of the manipulations needed for lens calculations and prepare for the analysis side by side with the values generated by an ray tracing software (Zemax). Those studies are enumerated next:\n\n- The power of the crystalline lens for an object at reading distance (50 cm) was calculated. The power of the crystalline lens for an object at infinity was also calculated.\n- The effect of water as a medium on the power of the crystalline lens was examined.\n- \u00b4The cornea + lens association was replaced with a lens, and the focal distance and optical power were calculated for an object at infinity.\n- The focal distance was determined when the lens was moved 1 mm forward and backward.\n- The main conducted study was the three power surface system model (glasses, cornea and lens association) evaluation for glasses power calculation when they are distanced 14mm from the cornea.\n- Additionaly, the brennan model on Zemax was implemented to compare the calculations made theoretically with the results provided by Zemax.\nThe parameters used in the brennan model are the same as the ones in their article and are shown in the table below. \nThis model implements some important aspects of the anatomy of the human eye that tries to accurately predicts the behaviour of the human eye. It is important to note the following aspects: \n- Crystalline lens with two different gradient refractive index profiles for the front and back half. The gradient indez of the lens is described by n(w,z)= n00 + n01z + n02z^2 + n10w^2, where z is along the optical axis, w is the radial distance perpendicular to the z axis (w= x^2 +y^2). In grad A, n00 =1.368, n01=0.049057, n02= -0.015427, n10=-0.001978; and in grad P, n00=1.407, n01=0.000000, n02=-0.006605, n10=-0.001978. For this effect, it was used the utility of GRIN surfaces, choosing the GRIN surface 5, described by the equation X. Comparing the liou brennan equation with this one, we can set each coeficient of the equation on Zemax.\n- offset pupil: the pupil was modeled as a circular aperture stop on the front surface of the lens with its center decentered 0.5 mm nasally from the optical axis\n- Angle alpha: The visual axis of the human eye does not coincide with the optical axis, as the fovea is normally displaced temporally from the optical axis. The angle between the optical axis and the visual axis is termed the angle alpha and is considered positive when the visual axis in object space lies on the nasal side of the optical axis. We have included a 5\u00b0 angle alpha in this new model\n- The Stiles\u2013Crawford effect : is incorporated into the calculation by introducing a two dimensional\nGaussian apodization filter for the amplitude of the effect. This has the form I 5 102(a/2)w2 where I is the intensity, a=0.05\n- Ray Aiming: set Ray Aiming to\u00a0\\*\\*Paraxial in order for the Zemax to be able to aim the rays at the undecentered paraxial entrance pupil.\\*\\*\n\nAt this point, two new surfaces (spaced 3 mm from each other) were added to represent the glasses, located 14 mm from the cornea ( a normal value for glasses).\nFinally, the radius of curvature of the cornea was changed from its original value of 7.77 mm to values between 7.62 mm and 8.62 mm and the power of the glasses need to process a image of quality was assessed, after optimization by the merit function on Zemax.",

        "prompt": "Act as a lead product manager for a startup company and using the information provided below. \n\nWrite up a product requirement document.\n\n\u201c StressXpress\n08 Nov 2022 version 1\nOverview.\nTo employ staff members the company has to invest in time, advertising, interviewing and on-board training. To lose and replace a staff member is an expensive process. The goal of this application is to allow the management to monitor the stress levels of each employee on a monthly basic and generate management reports based on a triage of status. Red being \u2018Burnout\u2019, Amber being \u2018Stressed\u2019 and Green being \u2018Acceptable\u2019.\nOnce this individual data is harvested the company has access to a broader set of information, such as examining the \u2018team\u2019, to understand the harmony of the team players.\nThe concept of the mobile application:\nThe server is loaded with three combinations of questions. This harvested detail will set the background of the employee. The server will analyse the detail and provide an on-boarding report and a current triage status for the employee, and a similar report to the employer.\nThe next stage is to monitor changes in the employee\u2019s behaviour. A green status will provoke an additional check in 30 periods, the amber status will provoke an additional check in 14-day periods and the Red status will provoke an additional check every 7 days.\nThis additional check will be in the form of a repetitive check of facial changes and voice algorithm analysis. This will also be graded as the triage colour.\nShould the employee be found to be in the red sector a gamification process will be evoked? This using the speed of the physical response to determine the ability of the employee to respond under stress.\nThe Companies responsibility: The Company will upload the employee\u2019s details and thereby control, who is actively being managed, The Company will be billed for the number of employees being managed in each month.\nStressXpress:\nStressXpress will generate on the server the psychological questions and the internal workings of the mathematical analysis and the storage and management of the historical data.\nThe employee mobile device:\nThe employee will open the mobile app and enter the identifying Email address, where the domain name is the identical name of the hosting company. This Email identifier does not have to be a real email address as the server does not dispatch emails. Thus ID1940@company.com is allowed. The password is also issued by the company. The company is being invoiced by the number of active employees. Therefore, they control the access to the application.\nThe second requirement is the individual password of the employee is solicited and both fields of information are dispatched to the server (REST) for validation.\nThe server will identify the parent company (of the current employment) and the password. If acceptable the server will respond with a list of menu items as choices. These will be URL links to the required web page.\nCurrently these menu lists ask for the next questionnaire or https://blob.iihf.com/iihf-media/iihfmvc/media/downloads/tenders/request\\_for\\_tenders\\_-\\_technology\\_assessement.pdfask to view an existing report.\nCurrently there are three questionnaire queries, the Mobile app will identify and handle these variations and transfer the detail back to the server.\nAfter the three, background questions have been answered the repetition of the facial and voice analysis will be repeated within the required periods. This process will also compute the triage colours.\nIf the employee is found to be in the red status the gamification process will supplant the facial and voice checks.\nThe Gamification is a process that involves the co-ordination of dexterity between the buttons and voice control of the application, which in turn will measure the ability to respond under pressure.\nWhen, if, the triage colour reverts to amber, the facial and voice will be reintroduced.\nThe Companies responsibility:\nShould the employee migrate to another employer who is participating with StressXpress, the additional initiation passwords would Link or point to the individual\u2019s personal data. Therefore, continuing with the existing history.\nReports:\nThe mobile application includes a menu to allow several options to be added, as expansion of the process evolves. One of these will be the ability to examine the previously defined reports.\nThe company will have access to the server and thereby be able to have a whole gambit of SQL possibilities of data analysis.\u201d",

Materials and Methods\n\nThis study utilized a retrospective cohort design to investigate the potential synergistic effect of statins and aspirin on adhesion prevention in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Medical records of 500 patients who underwent various types of abdominal surgery between 2018 and 2021 were reviewed. The surgical procedures included appendectomy (removal of the appendix), caesarean section (C-section), inguinal hernia surgery (repair of an inguinal hernia), abdominoperineal resection (treatment for anal and distal rectal cancer), and small bowel resection (removal of Crohn's disease, cancer, ulcers, benign tumors, and polyps).\n\nPatients were classified into groups based on their medication regimen before surgery. Those who had been taking statins for at least four weeks prior to surgery and those who had been taking aspirin for at least one week prior to surgery were included in the respective groups. The study population was divided into four groups: no medication (None), statins only (statin), aspirin only (aspirin), and a combination of statins and aspirin (statin + aspirin). This classification allowed for the evaluation of the individual and combined effects of statins and aspirin on the incidence of postoperative adhesions.\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was the incidence of postoperative adhesions within one year following abdominal surgery. This was defined as cases diagnosed with adhesions or patients presenting with symptoms related to adhesions within the follow-up period. Adhesions are a well-known complication of abdominal surgery, leading to chronic pain, bowel obstruction, and female infertility. Understanding the potential synergistic effect of statins and aspirin in preventing adhesions could have significant clinical implications, as both medications are widely used for their respective primary indications and have been individually studied for their roles in adhesion prevention.\n\nThe data collected from the medical records included patient demographics, type of abdominal surgery, preoperative medication use, and the presence or absence of postoperative adhesions within the one-year follow-up period. Exclusion criteria for the study were patients with incomplete medical records, those who underwent surgery for reasons other than the specified abdominal procedures, and patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to statins or aspirin.\n\nTo ensure the reliability and validity of the data, multiple researchers reviewed the medical records, and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Additionally, the data collection process was carried out independently and blinded to minimize any potential bias.\n\nThe Chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence of postoperative adhesions among the four groups. This statistical method is suitable for comparing categorical data, such as the presence or absence of adhesions, in multiple groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results of the Chi-square test were reported with the Chi-square statistic (\u03c72), degrees of freedom (df), and the p-value. \ub97c \ucc38\uace0\ud574\uc11c result\ub97c \uc4f8\uac74\ub370, result\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc544.

He already has a number of prestigious accolades to his name: a TIME album of the year, a Libera Award, and huge global streaming activity. He is now set to break in the UK with a major record deal with Decca and his first major UK show at the Southbank.\n\n\nHis latest video for \"passpied\" is a beautiful and fantastic juxtaposition of the old and new, urban and ornate. A hip-hop dancer dances the Baroque \"passpied\", first in a gritty-inner city setting, and then in a lavish 18th-century court.\n\nWould this be of interest for the CLASH website as an exclusive video premiere?

Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album\u2019s title refers to the \u201caubade\u201d, a morning love song about lovers separating at dawn. \n\nJean-Michel Blais has been a celebrated figure in the post-classical piano world since the release of his critically-acclaimed debut album II in 2016. He attended Quebec\u2019s prestigious Trois-Rivi\ufffd\ufffdres Music Conservatory but left after two years of study, exhausted by the restraints of the traditional music curriculum. Blais then travelled widely before retraining as a special education teacher. Whilst working as a teacher, he returned to music on his own terms, rediscovering his passion through improvising on the piano. These improvisations formed the basis of a recording career that has earned him a Polaris prize nomination, a #1 on the Billboard Classical chart and a Time Magazine top ten album of the year. \n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a \u201cfruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.\u201d Musical ideas captured in over 600 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Blais\u2019s hero Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass string. \n\nBlais also consciously found himself leaning towards major tonalities, which he believes are surprisingly rare in modern classical piano music. \u201cWith this album, I was definitely responding to certain trends in modern classical music,\u201d Blais reckons. \u201cFor example, the fact that the solo piano tends to sound melancholic. That\u2019s good, but I\u2019ve done that already, I wanted to go beyond that.\u201d \n\nIn aubades, every instrument is given moments of expression to an extent that took the players by surprise. \u201cWhen the Second Violin player, Nadia, came to look at the music she thought there was a mistake. She was the only violin playing. I\u2019d have to tell her \u2018It\u2019s not a mistake, it\u2019s your time to shine\u2019\u201d, Blais says, \u201cthere\u2019s often been this dominant idea in classical music that one instrument is the chief, the king of all the instruments, and the others are in the background merely supporting.\u201d He was inspired by more democratic musical textures from the Renaissance and Middle Ages, as well as the social democratic artistic ethos of the English 19th century poet, designer and activist William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. \n\nThe album\u2019s first single, \u201cmurmures\u201d, is released on 3 September. It is described by the composer as a tribute to Philip Glass. A minimal piano is joined by fluttering strings resembling birds in flight. The release date and tracklist for the album will be announced later this month. \n\nMercury KX \n\nMercury KX, launched in 2017 as part of Universal Music Group/Decca Records, celebrates genre-defying, multi-disciplinary artists.

        "prompt": "Here is the extract of the case, only reply \"acknowledged\" for now. \n\nA work order is the preferred, not the mandatory, outcome where there is a choice of remedy: Galdona v Peacock [2017] NSWCATAP 64. Personal animosity is not sufficient to displace the primacy of a work order for defective work as required by HBA s 48MA, as the test is objective, but relational breakdown is an element in objective assessment: Brooks v Gannon Constructions PL [2017] NSWCATCD 12 (appeal not affecting s 48MA decision); BNT Constructions PL v Allen [2017] NSWCATAP 186 at [33]-[36]; Kumar v Sabharwal [2017] NSWCATAP 200 at [29]-[30]; Clements v Murphy [2018] NSWCATAP 152; Brennan Constructions PL v Davison [2018] NSWCATAP 210 at [15]-[21].\n\nThe parties are also under an obligation under Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW) (CATA) s 36(3) to co-operate to achieve the guiding principle in CATA s 36(1) which extends to the necessary co-operation, including provision of access, to ensure that work orders can be implemented in an orderly manner: Maiolo v Chiarelli [2016] NSWCATAP 81 at [40]-[46], [55]. This reinforces the express obligation in HBA s 18BA(3)(b), (5).\n\nSuch a duty to co-operate is congruent with the parties' duties to act with fidelity to the bargain, not deny the other party the benefit of the bargain, and to co-operate by doing what was reasonably necessary to secure performance of the contract: Secured Income Real Estate PL v St Martins Property Investments PL (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607; and as to good faith, Mineralogy PL v Sino Iron PL [No 16] [2017] WASC 340 at [828]-[831]; Masters Home Improvement Aust PL v North East Solutions PL [2017] VSCA 88 at [99]; Macquarie International Health Clinic PL v SSWAHS [2010] NSWCA 268 at [12]; United Group Rail Services Ltd v Railcorp NSW (2009) 74 NSWLR 618 at [70]-[74], [100], [101].\n\nIn Little v J&K Homes PL [2017] NSWCATAP 84 at [24] an Appeal Panel of the Tribunal said that, \"[i]f a builder wrongfully refuses to complete building work governed by the HBA\", the Tribunal had jurisdiction pursuant to s 48O(1)(c)(i) to make a work order to direct the builder to complete specified work. The wording of the statutory provision does not include an additional element of conduct by use of the word \"wrongfully\". Accordingly, the Appeal Panel must have been referring to where the builder disputes liability for a defect and loses in that dispute or where the builder says it is ready, willing and able to remedy the alleged defect either in the course of completing the project or by acceptance that the work requires remediation after completion of the project.\n\nAlternatively, the words used by the Appeal Panel may simply be introductory to or descriptive of the general work that s 48O(1)(c) is intended to do. The discussion in Little at [20]-[28] makes it clear that the Appeal Panel was not intending a restricted scope for s 48O(1)(c) in its analysis. The Appeal Panel considered that the provision, in either or both of its sub-paragraphs, extended to ordering a builder whose licence had lapsed to fulfil contractual obligations by retaining a licensed builder to carry out the completion or remediation work.\n\nA narrow or restricted scope would not give effect to the broad words of s 48O. All that is required is for the Tribunal to be determining a \"building claim\" for the Tribunal to be empowered to make one or more of the permitted orders. \"Building claim\" is defined, for Part 3A in which s 48O appears, in s 48A(1) to mean (in summary) a claim for payment of money, supply of specified services, relief from payment, delivery, return or replacement of goods or a combination of the foregoing. The focus is on the existence and content of relief sought in the claim.\n\nIt could be argued that the exercise of the power in s 48O in conjunction with s 48MA is, or should in exercise of discretion be, affected by the conduct of the builder. If, for instance, a builder and an owner had agreed entirely on a schedule of work to be done and the builder was still entitled to the site or was being given reasonable access to the site as part of a resolution of proceedings, that may be a factor in simply noting the builder's undertaking to do the agreed remediation work, much as one would note an undertaking to a court in lieu of making a compulsive specific order, although in some circumstances it may still be appropriate to make a work order in those circumstances.\n\nWhere there is no such entire agreement - no coalescence between what an owner is prepared to accept and what the builder is prepared voluntarily to undertake - then, even if \"wrongful\" did have a part to play in the exercise of discretion, there would be a \"wrongful refusal to complete building work\" if any of the items outside of what the builder was prepared to accept voluntarily was found to be required to be completed after a contested hearing. A work order in the usual course would be required for those items. Usually there would be no obvious benefit to having a work order for some items and no work order for other items in that situation.\n\nA work order does not enable the Tribunal in effect to impose on the builder, by that work order, a binding scope of works and/or a different practical completion date or state. In relation to exercise of discretion whether or not to make a work order, the Tribunal would ordinarily take into account whether the contract period for the works had passed, the state of the works, nature of the work compared with what remained to be completed, and the proportionality principles discussed below.\n\nA factor in the exercise of discretion to grant a work order is the need to give confidence to both parties about, not only the scope of works complained about in these proceedings that are found to require completion or remediation, but also the time in which they are to be performed and what happens if they are not performed or if there is a dispute over performance, and associated questions such as reasonable access. The guiding principles for work orders that are set out in the cases already cited indicate there may be a benefit in an order, coupled with the necessary order for access, to achieve co-operative endeavour.\n\nThe making of a work order also fits within the mechanism for renewal of proceedings for any alleged non-compliance provided for in CATA Sch 4 para 8. The right to renew is usually expressly provided for if a party considers a work order or access order has not been properly complied with. The relations between the parties may not have been sufficiently damaged to deny the statutory preference for a work order but may mean that a renewal application to seek relief for alleged non-compliance is a real risk of occurrence. Renewal to seek an alternative order to the work order, such as monetary compensation, necessarily will bring the contract to an end if it has not already ended, as the Appeal Panel made clear in Blessed Sydney Constructions PL v Vasudevan, cited earlier, at [27], [40]-[43], [49]-[53], [58]-[75].",

In these cases, simply trying again might resolve the issue.\n\nAn error component can use the reset() function to prompt the user to attempt to recover from the error. When executed, the function will try to re-render the Error boundary's contents. If successful, the fallback error component is replaced with the result of the re-render.\n\napp/dashboard/error.tsx\n'use client';\n\nexport default function Error({\n error,\n reset,\n}: {\n error: Error;\n reset: () => void;\n}) {\n return (\n \n Something went wrong!\n---------------------\n reset()}>Try again\n \n );\n}\nNested Routes\nReact components created through special files are rendered in a specific nested hierarchy.\n\nFor example, a nested route with two segments that both include layout.js and error.js files are rendered in the following simplified component hierarchy:\n\nThe rendered nested component hierarchy of two route segments with layout.js and error.js special files\nThe nested component hierarchy has implications for the behavior of error.js files across a nested route:\n\nErrors bubble up to the nearest parent error boundary. This means an error.js file will handle errors for all its nested child segments. More or less granular error UI can be achieved by placing error.js files at different levels in the nested folders of a route.\nAn error.js boundary will not handle errors thrown in a layout.js component in the same segment because the error boundary is nested inside that layouts component.\nHandling Errors in Layouts\nerror.js boundaries do not catch errors thrown in layout.js or template.js components of the same segment. This intentional hierarchy keeps important UI that is shared between sibling routes (such as navigation) visible and functional when an error occurs.\n\nTo handle errors within a specific layout or template, place an error.js file in the layouts parent segment.\n\nTo handle errors within the root layout or template, use a variation of error.js called global-error.js.\n\nHandling Errors in Root Layouts\nThe root app/error.js boundary does not catch errors thrown in the root app/layout.js or app/template.js component.\n\nTo specifically handle errors in these root components, use a variation of error.js called app/global-error.js located in the root app directory.\n\nUnlike the root error.js, the global-error.js error boundary wraps the entire application, and its fallback component replaces the root layout when active. Because of this, it is important to note that global-error.js must define its own and tags.\n\nglobal-error.js is the least granular error UI and can be considered \"catch-all\" error handling for the whole application. It is unlikely to be triggered often as root components are typically less dynamic, and other error.js boundaries will catch most errors.\n\nEven if a global-error.js is defined, it is still recommended to define a root error.js whose fallback component will be rendered within the root layout, which includes globally shared UI and branding.\n\napp/global-error.tsx\n'use client';\n\nexport default function GlobalError({\n error,\n reset,\n}: {\n error: Error;\n reset: () => void;\n}) {\n return (\n \n \n \n Something went wrong!\n---------------------\n reset()}>Try again\n \n \n );\n}\nHandling Server Errors\nIf an error is thrown during data fetching or inside a Server Component, Next.js will forward the resulting Error object to the nearest error.js file as the error prop.\n\nWhen running next dev, the error will be serialized and forwarded from the Server Component to the client error.js. To ensure security when running next start in production, a generic error message is forwarded to error along with a .digest which contains a hash of the error message. This hash can be used to correspond to server logs.\n\nNext Steps\nLoading UI\nLearn how to create Loading States for your application.\nerror.js\nRequired and optional params for error files.",

The storm, however, has yet to subside as it intensified every second. The torrential rain sent tremors down every fiber of my body.

Use good 12th grade English style writing.\nIt has been quiet this whole time, out here where I am: in my apartment perched above the settlement, in Erethel. I am close enough to where others are to observe, to go out among them in my daily reckonings as what I\u2019m expected to be here, a reclusive writer named Theyla Keth who goes into the village with her shawl over her head. I go as an old human woman because there is no one more invisible. I do my business, and return to my home, and spend the rest of my time submitting my recordings to the Library branch. And when I am home, I am myself again, and I spend my time recovering from the effort.\nI am left alone, just myself and my robots, and Richard Bot, who runs a number of my errands for me while I do my archiving.\nRichard Bot is the only person I trust to keep me safe, and he keeps me safe. I know his programming may be flawed, but he does his best, and I trust him to do his best. I have no doubt that he will protect me, however much I may want to run away. I am at my desk one day when I feel the walls shake. There is a rumbling. And finally, an engine cutting out. Someone has landed an aircraft on the roof of the mud brick apartment complex. Inconsiderate. My concentration will be ruined for the rest of the day, and I feel my anger grow.I shove my pen back down onto the desk, stand abruptly, and reach for my hooded cloak and the walking stick that will be expected with this role. I stand shakily, but am going to storm outside and give this lout a piece of my mind. I am going to let him know that I am not going to tolerate being menaced by everyone who comes up this road.\nI open the door to my room and step out, and I freeze. It is Val Renberg, backlit by the sun, setting her fair hair ablaze. She wears not the Co-Op patched flight suit, nor the white and gold, but plain brown leathers. Her face is harder and more angular than it was when I met her, back on Kybaria, those years ago: her golden hair beginning to give in to white at the temples, but the severe style is the same, the goggles are the same, and she pushes them up onto her forehead, and her dark green gaze is as intense as any Xirin\u2019s. For a long time I can do nothing but drink her in with my eyes. Eventually I will have to speak and explain why I am standing here. But for now, I just stand stunned... unable to move. I feel a twinge in my body at seeing her, as if I'll never be able to forget the night we spent together just some months ago. \nShe looks at me, and then away again. I take a step forward, and stop again. I realize that I am trembling slightly.\nI am standing before her, my mouth dry, my heart beating so fast that I can hear it.\nShe turns her head to look up at me.\n\"Odyl?\" she says, barely audibly, her lip quivering slightly. \nAnd all at once I am aware of how vulnerable I am. I am barefoot, wearing only a robe and a thin sheath of a dress under it, and carrying no weapon.\n\"Yes,\" I say, \"Val.\"\nShe steps forward, and takes my hands. The touch of her hand makes me tremble.\n\"You're real,\" she says.\nShe steps forward, and pulls me into her arms, and I am held tightly against her body. She smells of sweat and leather, and I breathe deeply of her scent.\nI feel the tears welling up, and I bury my face in her shoulder. Her arms tighten around me.\nI nod, and wipe my eyes, hoping she didn't see.\n\"Let's go inside,\" she says.\nI lead her back up the stairs, and we walk through the rooms as they begin to fill with evening light. I show her the kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom, the sitting room. She nods understandingly, and follows me everywhere.\nIn the living room, she sits down on the sofa, surrounded by the piles of books and media I've been collating, and I sit next to her. \n\"What brings you here,\" I ask. \"Something for DSES?\"\n\nShe didn't speak for a long time, and finally, she looked up at me. \"No. I'm done, Odyl,\" she said. \"I quit DSES, and cashed out my pension. Been staying at Novaya Waypoint. I'm waiting on my years of hazard pay to cash out so I can buy a ship.\"\nI sat with this for some time, and we didn't say anything.\n\"What brings you out this way, Val?\"\n\"Had to see you before I went on,\" she said.\nFinally, she reached inside her leather jacket, to the breast pocket of her button-down shirt, and I exhaled sharply: I recognized the small square of folded paper. She held it for a moment, and then, set it down on the table in front of us (on top of a stack of books and media yet to be tagged and scanned). The letter I'd written, thinking I was never going to see her again, that I needed her to know my side of this before that happened and our fates swept us to our respective... whatever. That night, those couple of months ago... we spent our last night together making love all night long, before she finally left for her ship. I finally had slipped the letter into her jacket pocket before she left, knowing I might never see her again. Space was just too big. My lips were trembling, and I could hardly breathe. \nShe didn't speak, her mouth a grim line for a moment. She was quiet, looking at her scarred, rough hands with their bitten-off short fingernails, and finally, she reached forward, and took my hands in hers.\nFinally, she said, softly, roughly: \"Dyl, I... don't want to live this life anymore. I want something else, something new. I'm tired of this life, and I want to live like a human being.\"\nI nodded.\nShe was stroking my knuckles with her thumbs, much as she had that night on Kybaria those years ago, in Father's garden. She closed her eyes for a moment, took a deep breath, and after a long moment, exhaled raggedly. She looked tired, haggard. Her eyes opened, meeting mine, searching my face, then looking away. \n\"What are you saying, Val?\"\nMy throat clenched painfully, and, I realized, I had been squeezing her hands back. She held my gaze for a moment longer, and then dropped them. \n\"Dyl, I...\" she started, her voice hoarse, \"I couldn't get you out of my head. Not a single moment of a single day. I want to be with you. I don't... want to run anymore. Run from life. Run from love. I can't do this anymore, what I've been doing. I love you, and I'm tired.\"\nMy throat was closing, choking me. Tears were burning in my eyes, threatening to spill over.",

        "prompt": "From the following information, write a a similar document, but better worded and more concise. \n\nPlaces to Put a Titan Balance Assist Titan pole for the Elderly\nA Titan pole is helpful for individuals after surgery, acute illness, physical injury or those with chronic health conditions that affect their strength, balance and endurance. This home safety equipment is especially helpful for frail elderly that are more prone to falls and deconditioning following a hospital stay.\nTitan Balance Assist Titan poles for the elderly are usually found in these three places within the home:\n1. Bathroom \u2013 useful for safely getting in or out of the bathtub or shower.\nBathing and showering is an activity that can be challenging for some individuals, particularly those that are recovering from surgery, have a recent hospital stay or any significant disability. \n\nBUY AT AMAZON\nThese individuals may benefit from having a Titan pole to grab onto for support with stepping into or out of the shower or bathtub. With a security Titan pole, a grab handle can be within reach to steady someone while they are standing to have a shower, or be used for help with standing up from a shower stool.\nFurthermore, the Titan pole can be positioned near the toilet to help with slowly sitting down or standing up from the toilet seat.\n2. Bedroom \u2013 great for repositioning one\u2019s body within bed and using it for support to lift oneself out of bed.\nMany beds are low which can make standing up challenging. Furthermore, mattresses often have some give to them that cause them to sink slightly under someone\u2019s body weight. Together these two factors make standing up harder, especially if one has any form of weakness in their legs.\n\nBUY AT AMAZON\nWith a floor to ceiling Titan pole positioned at the bedside, an individual can grab it to help pull themselves up from bed and steady themselves as they walk away, start to use a gait aid or transfer to a wheelchair for mobility assistance.\n3. Living Room \u2013 helpful for moving into a chair or couch and for assistance with standing up.\nAnother room to place a transfer Titan pole is within the living room. In this room, it can be used to help someone reposition within their favorite chair or couch. It can also be used to assist with lowering themselves into the seat or help with rising out of it.\nA security Titan pole is usually used by seniors that wish to age in place and live independently on their own with less support from family or private caregivers. Given that the living room is often a main living space for many, a supportive bar to help with standing and balance can be useful when no one else is around to provide assistance.\nImportant considerations when installing a floor to ceiling Titan pole\nEach home has a different layout and every individual has their own capabilities. In order to successfully install and safely use a floor mounted ceiling Titan pole, some certain conditions must be met:\n1. Height of the room must not be too tall \u2013 the ceiling must be 9 feet high or lower when installing most Titan poles.\nWhile tension mounted floor to ceiling Titan poles are height adjustable to fit rooms with varying sizes, the maximum ceiling height capable of accommodating this equipment is generally 9 feet tall. \nAnything beyond this height would either require a Titan pole extension to be used to lengthen the bar even further, or to utilize an alternative standing aid to support someone with balance and getting up from a seat.\n2. Need good upper body strength for pulling \u2013 sufficient grasping and upper arm strength is required to use the Titan pole.\nThis equipment does not do the work for you, rather it helps to offload some of the strength required to stand into other parts of your body to assist with the movement. If someone has a slight to moderate amount of weakness in their torso or legs, they may be able to continue to stand up on their own by grabbing this Titan pole for support and pulling themselves up. \nHowever, if someone is incapacitated or physically disabled to the point where they require assistance from two or more caregivers with standing, an alternate supportive aid may need to be considered. \n3. Must be able to weight bear through the legs \u2013 one must be able to stand for short periods of time if using this equipment.\nIn order to use this equipment, one must be able to bear weight through their legs while transferring onto another nearby surface or seat. If someone were to have no ability to place weight through their lower body, they would drop to the floor the very instance they stand up and try to rely on their legs for balance.\n4. Clearance needed around the Titan pole \u2013 there must be enough room to safely maneuver around the Titan pole.\nIn order to move to another surface or start using a mobility device, there should be enough clearance around the Titan pole. This can be particularly challenging because the Titan pole itself must also be within reach of the bed, bath/shower or preferred chair as having a Titan pole in the centre of the room with nothing around it serves no purpose.\nThus, when considering the layout of one\u2019s living space, a floor to ceiling Titan pole can start to make the room feel crowded and busy relatively quickly. Careful thought must be placed in regards to its location as the bar itself can interfere with walking or positioning a wheelchair near the equipment.\n5. Regular maintenance must be performed \u2013 check the equipment regularly to ensure it remains sturdy and well secured in place.\nFor any medical equipment, safety measures must be taken to ensure the device is in good working order. For a security Titan pole, this means that the mechanism must be checked for appropriate tension to ensure that it is able to bear someone\u2019s weight during any transfer attempt. \nAs well, the equipment must be wiped down regularly of any moisture or water exposure to ensure that the material does not rust or degrade overtime. This is especially for Titan poles that are situated within the bathroom where surfaces may get wet more easily.\n6. Titan pole users must have intact cognition \u2013 must have the capacity to understand how to safely utilize the equipment to facilitate a transfer.\nIn order to safely use a floor to ceiling transfer Titan pole and not sustain a fall during a transfer attempt, one must understand the steps that need to be taken during any movement with the Titan pole\u2019s support.\nFor example, someone that has impaired thinking or rationalization skills may not follow appropriate transfer mechanics. This could make getting out of bed, or the shower more difficult and potentially dangerous if someone does not have insight into their own physical abilities or understand how they should position their body to safely get up.\nIt is well known that cognition can fluctuate throughout the day depending on one\u2019s energy levels, nutritional intake, and pain levels. So it is important that a cognitive assessment be completed to determine safety with using transfer aids. In most cases, a physician, or an allied rehab therapist trained on basic home safety and medical equipment can help determine if one is safe to use a floor to ceiling Titan pole.",

        "prompt": "Give me a brief scenario of a persona that would search this information and find this content helpful: {What is a Construction Management Contract?\nThe basic premise of a Construction Management (CM) Contract is that the Owner, referred to as the \u2018Principal\u2019 under the contract, enters into a contract with a Construction Manager. The Construction Manager is responsible for arranging and supervising the performance of work by sub-contractors.\n\nEssentially, a CM contract is one whereby the Owner enters into an arrangement for someone, often a registered builder although it is not a requirement, to manage the construction works. This is in contrast to a \u2018traditional\u2019 building contract whereby the Owner enters into a contract with a Builder directly. The Builder is responsible for engaging all sub-contractors and directing the works, and provides the Owner with warranties as to the quality of the works.\n\nUnder certain Construction Management contracts, there may also be a third party referred to as the \u2018Client\u2019s Representative\u2019 (CR). It is common for an Owner to appoint an Architect to this position. The CR is responsible for deciding on matters such as extension of time claims by the Construction Manager, giving directions to the Construction Manager and inspecting the site to assess progress prior to the submission of each progress claim by the Construction Manager.\n\nWho engages the sub-contractors?\nPursuant to a CM contract, there are two options for sub-contractors to be engaged to complete the works.\n\nThe first is where the sub-contractors enter into individual trade contracts with the Principal (the Owner) to carry out the required works. If the Principal chooses to take this route, the Principal will be responsible for payment of the sub-contractors for the work completed.\n\nThe alternative method is for the sub-contractors to enter into individual trade contracts with the Construction Manager. In this case, the Construction Manager will be responsible for payment of the sub-contractors and this amount will be added to the payment claims provided to the Owner by the Construction Manager. Obviously, such payment claims from the Construction Manager must include supporting verification of claims by the trades.\n\nWhat happens if there are defective works?\nEach of the trade contracts entered into with the sub-contractors will contain provisions relating to defect liability periods and warranties for work performed. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the provisions of each individual trade contract and to obtain expert legal advice before entering into such contracts.\n\nDepending upon the terms of the CM contract, it is possible that the Construction Manager will also provide warranties for defective work by a sub-contractor. It is, however, far more likely that the CM contract will contain a provision expressly stating that the Construction Manager will not be liable to the Owner for any acts or omissions by the sub-contractors. If that is the case, then the Owner will only have a claim against the individual sub-contractors for any defective work.\n\nNotwithstanding the inclusion of any provision similar to that described above, the Construction Manager can be liable to the Owner for any breach of the CM contract or for failing to properly manage and arrange the carrying out of the works by the sub-contractors. There will be duties to the Owner spelt out in the CM contract and also a duty of care at common law.\n\nShould I use a Construction Management contract?\nWhile there are benefits to using a CM contract in certain situations, there are also risks involved as the Principal (the Owner) takes on many more risks than in a traditional building contract with a builder. This is particularly noteworthy if it is domestic rather than commercial construction.\n\nIf you are considering entering into a CM contract for your project, it is essential that you seek expert legal advice regarding the risks involved and the terms of the specific contract you are considering entering into.}\nPlease write in English language.",

They have\nevolved over time and brought about numerous benefits to\ncivilization.\nToday\u2019s Article\nThe earliest record of a kite is from Mozi, a philosopher\nduring China\u2019s Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 BC\u2013221 BC). His kite was\na bird made of wood with a string attached to it.\nToday\u2019s Article\nDuring the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 AD\u2013220 AD), paper kites\nemerged, and kites were formally named. They originally helped\nsoldiers measure distances and wind direction.\nToday\u2019s Article\nAs kites spread to other parts of Asia, each country\ndeveloped a distinctive way of using them. In Japan, kites became\npart of religious ceremonies. They were used to bring good luck to\nharvests. In Korea, kites were flown to symbolize the letting go of\nbad luck and welcoming of good fortune.\nToday\u2019s Article\nKites were first brought to the Western world by Marco Polo,\nwho supposedly first saw a kite in 1282. In the 16th and 17th\ncenturies, other sailors also brought kites back from expeditions to\nthe East.\nToday\u2019s Article\nThey were used in science experiments, such as Benjamin\nFranklin\u2019s 1752 experiment with electricity that led to the\ninvention of the lightning rod. Experimentation with kites also\ncaused a breakthrough that led to the invention of the airplane.\nToday\u2019s Article\nSince World War II, though, kites have been mainly used as a\nsource of entertainment. Nevertheless, it\u2019s interesting to know\nthat this simple toy has more than 2,000 years of history behind it.\nToday\u2019s Article\n- Briefly summarize the article .",

        "prompt": "I confess, with only a touch of embarrassment, that I had no idea until we started working on this book that each vertebra was really a two-part bone. There is the more or less solid and weight-bearing portion toward your front, called \u201cthe vertebral body\u201d (with the discs in between). And then there\u2019s this flying buttress\u2013looking piece that sticks off the back (the \u201cvertebral arch\u201d). And there is a very important space between the two sections. The \u201chollow\u201d down the middle of your spine is really a space between these two segments of the vertebra. The vertebra is one solid piece of bone but with two very distinct segments and a hole down the middle where the spinal cord goes. \nThe Spinal Column\n\nDo you see the spiny-looking pieces in the picture, above, sticking off the vertebrae? Those are pieces of the vertebral arch. They are called \u201cthe spinous processes\u201d (no one cares), and they are basically anchor points. That\u2019s where ligaments can attach muscles to the vertebrae. If you\u2019re a sailor, think of cleats on the deck, for ropes. When you reach back and feel the spiny part of your back, you\u2019re feeling the \u201cspinous processes\u201d or the cleats. By the way, the ligaments or sinews are the lines (think \u201cstays\u201d on a sailboat) that hold your spine erect. Without stays, the mast on a sailboat would flop around and break in no time; with stays, the mast on a well-designed sailboat is remarkably stable. Flexible, like your spine, but stable and strong, too. \nOkeydoke, on to the discs. This is familiar territory to most of us. You hear about discs all the time. \u201cBulging discs,\u201d \u201cpinched discs,\u201d \u201cslipped discs,\u201d \u201cruptured discs\u201d and so on. They are basically washers to keep the weight-bearing parts of the vertebrae from rubbing on one another and to put some \u201cgive\u201d into your back. You cannot have an articulated stack of bones without a wonderfully effective stack of washers to keep \u2019em apart, and you do. Think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts, as I mentioned before. There is a tough, fibrous layer on the outside and a gooey or liquid core on the inside. They act as shock absorbers and have a lot to do with letting you bend. Dysfunctional discs can be a major source of problems and pain. \nA YOUNG PERSON\u2019S PROBLEMS\nThis is interesting. Bulging and actually ruptured discs are mostly a young person\u2019s problem, people in their thirties (and you kids are welcome to them; they really hurt). Older people have horrendous problems, too; after all, some 35 percent of people from ages forty-five to sixty-five have serious back pain. But usually not this particular horror. Which also means that more younger people are going to get bundled off to the surgeon, if the problem is grim enough. Older people have disc problems, too, but nowhere near as often. \nTake a long look at the pictures on the next pages. They show you how the spinal cord, spine, and discs work together. First is a side view depicting how the brain, spinal cord, and spine are positioned in the body. Second is a close-up of a segment made up of two vertebrae with their disc (in gray) in between and the spinal cord and nerve roots visible. Notice how the rear parts of the adjoining vertebrae form a canal through which the spinal cord runs from top to bottom. Also notice how the two adjoining vertebrae form holes, or \u201cforamina,\u201d on the sides where the nerve roots come out of the spine. Those holes are super-important: The holes can become smaller from disc degeneration or movement of the vertebrae on top of each other. And the nerve that comes out of the hole is pressured, and it hurts like blazes. Not to get too scary, but when things really go to hell and you actually rupture or split the disc open with your ridiculous posture or whatnot, the pain really goes over the top. (Good news: You hear about ruptured discs all the time, but they are comparatively rare.) Bones wear on bones, discs hurt like crazy, and the stuff in the middle squirts all over the place. Which is bad because it causes severe chemical pain in the nerves. Not so good. When we say that there are times when traditional medicine (surgery) has a critical role, this is one of them. \nNote the bits of bone to the left in the close-up side view vertebral segment. These are \u201cthe facet joints.\u201d The point of this picture is to show how they are right next to the spinal cord and near one of the nerve exit spots. They are well placed, in other words, to raise hell if things go wrong with them. I forgot to mention this: The surfaces of the facet joints are covered in cartilage, which allows smooth movement in a healthy spine. So what? The point is that this cartilage can be abraded or torn by dumb moves, too, and that hurts as well. \nHere are two more views, below. Note the sort of circular thing with the lighter insides. That\u2019s a cross section of a disc, seen from the top. \n\nLigaments and Tendons\nAll right, that\u2018s the spinal cord and the spinal column. But they would not stand alone without a ton of support. Think of the spinal column as a slender reed. If you press down on it at all from above (or the sides), it will bend crazily. Indeed, it cannot sustain any weight at all to speak of. But now, add a bunch of support lines from the pole to a solid support, and it\u2019s a different story. Our backbone has a lot of very sturdy support lines called ligaments and tendons (ligaments connect bone to bone; tendons connect bone to muscle.) There are an awful lot of ligaments connected to the spine. The following picture gives you the idea. \nHere\u2019s another thing you need to know: Ligaments can become deformed or sprained because of bad posture, a persistent pattern of bad movements, or an injury. When that happens to a ligament, the joints those ligaments were supporting \u201cget loose\u201d and can slip around. That is really bad. Here is a language alert: A \u201csprain\u201d is an unhealthy stretch or tear of a ligament, and a \u201cstrain\u201d is an unhealthy stretch or tear in a tendon or muscle. Look at the picture on the opposite page: there are a ton of ligaments here, all waiting to go haywire if you are foolish or unlucky. \nSpinal Ligaments",

It makes no sense, if you ask me.\n\u201cWho can tell me what two times ten equals?\u201d asked my teacher, Miss Daisy.\nA few kids raised their hands. I didn\u2019t. Miss Daisy called on this crybaby girl Emily, who has red hair.\n\u201cMiss Daisy, I don\u2019t feel very well,\u201d Emily said. \u201cCan I go to the nurse\u2019s office?\u201d\n\u201cRest your head on your desk for a few minutes, Emily,\u201d said Miss Daisy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel better, you can go seeMrs. Cooney.\u201d\nEmily put her head on her desk.\n\u201cNow who can tell me what two times ten equals?\u201d Miss Daisy asked again. \u201cA.J.?\u201d \n\nI had no idea what two times ten equalled. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I had to think fast.\nI knew that two plus two is four. And I knew that two times two is also four. So I knew that addition and multiplication were pretty much the same thing.\nI also knew that two plus ten equals twelve. So two times ten must equal twelve too.\n\u201cTwelve?\u201d I guessed.\n\u201cSorry, A.J.,\u201d said Miss Daisy.\n\u201cOooh, I know!\u201d said Andrea Young, this really annoying girl with curly brown hair. She was waving her hand back and forth like it was on fire. \u201cCall on me, Miss Daisy. Please?\u201d\nAndrea thinks she knows everything. I wish I could punch her.\nBut nah-nah-nah boo-boo on her, because Andrea didn\u2019t get the chance to answer. At that very moment, the most amazing thing in the history of the world happened.\nEmily got up from her seat really fast. She ran to the window. And then she threw up!\nIt was cool. Me and my friends Michael and Ryan looked at each other and tried not to laugh. I was glad that I wasn\u2019t walking under that window when Emily threw up.\nAfter she finished puking her guts out, Emily ran out of the room crying.\n\u201cGo to Mrs. Cooney\u2019s office, Emily!\u201d Miss Daisy yelled to her. Then Miss Daisy went to the intercom and told Mrs. Cooney that Emily was on her way down there\n\nIt took a few minutes for all of us to stop talking about what had happened. I mean, it wasn\u2019t every day that a kid tossed her cookies out the window. I was sure Miss Daisy would forget all about math after that.\nBut no way.\n\u201cNow, A.J., try to figure it out,\u201d Miss Daisy said. \u201cTwo times ten. Two tens. We went over this. Think hard.\u201d\nSo I thought hard. I thought and I thought and I thought.\nThis is what I thought\u2014Emily is going to get to go home. She doesn\u2019t have to sit through math. That lucky stiff.\nMy friend Billy around the corner who was in second grade last year told me about this kid in his class who got to go home from school after he sneezed with his eyes open and his eyeballs fell out. Right out of his head!\nI wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, but I did know one thing. If you get sick, you get to go home. I didn\u2019t want my eyeballs to fall out of my head, but I wanted to go home. I wanted to get out of math.\nI started moaning.\n\u201cA.J., are you okay?\u201d asked Miss Daisy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel well,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I might have to throw up out the window. I think I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d\n\u201cThere must be something going around,\u201d said Miss Daisy. \u201cGo to Mrs.Cooney\u2019s office! And hurry\nAll right!\nI was a genius! On my way out of the class, I winked at Ryan and Michael.\n\u201cSolong, suckers!\u201dI whispered.\u201cHave fun in math!\u201d\nI had been to the nurse\u2019s office a few times before. OnceI fell off the monkey bars in the playground and landed on my head. I had to go to the hospital and everything. It was cool. The doctor took an X-ray of my brain, but he told me he didn\u2019t find anything. Then he laughed even though he didn\u2019t say anything funny.\nGetting out of math wasn\u2019t the only reason I wanted to go to Mrs. Cooney\u2019s office. There was another reason.\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is. I shouldn't be telling you.\nOkay, I'll tell you. But you have to promise not to tell anybody else or you're going to die as soon as the words leave your lips.\nHere it is.\nMrs. Cooney is the most beautiful lady in the history of the\nworld.Save & SubmitCancel",

        "prompt": "David J. Collis concludes:\nThe solution is not to alter the company\u2019s competitive position. If Edward Jones changed its customer scope by serving day traders, it would be positioned in the most price-competitive part of the market. If it altered its model of entrepreneurial advisers who are embedded in communities, it would lose its cooperative, client-interests-first culture. The best hope for escaping commoditization is to pursue business model innovation that creates more value and potentially monetizes it in ways other than just a commission on each transaction.\n\nEdward Jones is therefore following the path that other professional services firms have taken and is shifting from a product, or \u201ctransactional,\u201d business model to a financial life \u201csolutions\u201d business model. Through a five-step process that begins with documenting individual goals, the firm now offers customized advice and solutions for lifelong needs, not just purchases of mutual funds or blue-chip stocks. Though this approach requires more-intense engagement with customers, it creates substantially more value for them.\n\nMany entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they\u2019re likely to face.\n\nIn its efforts to successfully shift to the financial life solutions model, Edward Jones has identified must-win battles in several areas, including diversity (while about half of Generation Z is nonwhite, fewer than 15% of the firm\u2019s advisers belong to minority groups); intergenerational wealth transfer (an estimated $40 trillion in assets will be inherited by Millennials); and multichannel distribution (to effectively serve a full range of clients regardless of net worth and to complement in-person services with digital interactions). The firm has created teams, each of which works on part of a broader initiative\u2014for instance, how to enter urban markets with a large minority population\u2014to develop and test approaches addressing those challenges. Specific projects will come and go over time, but the focus on building capabilities required for long-term success will remain.\n\nNotice that we need to look at the whole strategy landscape to understand the change under way at Edward Jones. First, new developments (in demographics, regulation, capital markets\u2019 performance, and so on) are throwing up novel threats and opportunities. Second, the reduction in value capture for the industry is undermining the old business model. Third, the business model itself now needs to be retooled to create more value even if the competitive positioning is unchanged. And fourth, the revisions will take place through projects that support broader strategic initiatives.\n\nThe most important lesson is that to craft a resilient strategy, companies of all sizes must integrate all the elements of the complete strategy landscape. While not disregarding how critical competitive positioning is to value capture, an effective strategy process must begin with a creative and open-ended discussion of the value potential of alternative business models and finish with an approach to execution that guides ongoing experimentation and operational adaptation while investing in underlying capabilities.\n\nStrategy has always been about aligning the organization behind a clear direction. Today it must be broadened to become an integrated set of choices about the business model, competitive positioning, and capabilities required for long-term success. By managing the complete strategy landscape, CEOs of young ventures will greatly increase the odds that their firms won\u2019t crash and burn, and leaders of established companies will ensure that they continually renew themselves.",

        "prompt": "I have a company founded in colombia on march 2022. In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline\u2019s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided. Please ask as many questions as you need about what you need to know to provide a comprehensive answer.",

We start by extending the default allowed tags with `svg`. We then extend the default allowed attributes with `\"*\": [\"*\"]` to allow all attributes for all tags, including SVG tags.\n\nFinally, we use the `sanitizeHtml` function to sanitize the dirty SVG string. We pass in the dirty SVG string as the first argument and the `options` object as the second argument. The `sanitizeHtml` function returns a sanitized string that only includes allowed tags and attributes. We then log the sanitized SVG string to the console.\n\nNote that `sanitize-html` may still sanitize the SVG string if it detects any potentially malicious content. Therefore, it's important to test your SVG code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected after sanitization.\n\n`\n }\n ]\n}\n\nCan you read this OK?",

Take classification tasks as the prime application of neural networks. In this setting, when optimized using gradient descent with cross-entropy loss, these networks can achieve zero training error and low training loss. For classification tasks, achieving zero-training error, often also called interpolating the data, corresponds to perfect classification of the dataset. Despite their large capacity, they also have a remarkable ability to generalize to new data. In recent years, numerous studies have examined the generalization properties of gradient methods in overparameterized models and neural networks. These works, starting with \\citep{jacot2018neural}, have specifically focused on the generalization and optimization of neural networks in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, where the model operates as the first-order approximation of the network at a sufficiently large initialization\"",

        "prompt": "Default logic is a formalism in which default rules can be written to generate contin\u0002gent, nonmonotonic conclusions. A default rule looks like this: \nBird (x) : Flicg{x),/ Flica(x) . \nThis mile means that if Bird |x) is true, and if Flies) is consistent with the knowledge base, \nthen Flies(r) may be concluded by default. In general, a default Tule has the form \nP:h,...,J fC \nwhere I? is called the prerequisite, OF is the conclusion, and J; are the justfications\u2014if any \none of them can be proven false, then the conclusion cannot be drawn. Any variable that \nappears in J; or 7 must also appear in 7. The Nixon-diamond example can be represented \nin default logic with one fact and two default rules: \nRepublican Nizon) A Quaker{ Niron) . \nRepublican (xr) : \u2014Pacifist{z)/\u2014-Pacifist(x) . \nQuaker(x) : Pacifist (x) Pocifist |x) . \nTo interpret what the default mules mean, we define the notion of an extension of a default \ntheory to be a maximal set of consequences of the theory. That is, an extension S consists \nof the original known facts and a set of conclusions from the default rales, such that mo \nadditional conclusions can be drawn from 5 and the justifications of every default conclusion \nin 5 are consistent with 5. As in the case of the prefemaed models in circumscription, we have \nwo possible extensions for the Nixon diamond: one wherein he is a pacifist and one wherein \nhe is not. Prioritized schemes exist in which some default males can be given precedence over \nothers, allowing some ambiguities to be resolved.\n\nSince 1980, when nonmonotonic logics were first proposed, a great deal of progress \nhas bean made in understanding their mathematical properties. There are still unresolved \nquestions, however. For example, if \u201cCars have four wheels\" is false, what does it mean \nwo have it in one\u2019s knowledge base? What is a good set of default rules to have? If we \ncannot decide, for each rule separately, whether it belongs in our knowledge base, then we \nhave a serious problem of nonmoedularity. Finally, how can beliefs that have default status be \nused ww make decisions? This is probably the hardest issue for default reasoning. Decisions \noften imvolve radeoffzs, and one therefore needs to compare the sireagifiis of belief in the \noutcomes of different actions, and the costs of making a wrong decision. In cases where the \nsame Kinds of decisions are being made repeatedly, it is possible to interpret default males \nas \u201cthreshold probability\u2122 statements. For example, the default mule \u201cMy brakes are always \nOE\" really means \u201cThe probability that my brakes are OK, given no other information, is \nsufficiently high that the optimal decision is for me wo drive without checking them.\u201d When \nthe decision context changes\u2014~for example, when one is driving a heavily laden truck down a \nsteep mountain road \u2014the default rule suddenly becomes inappropriate, even though thers is \nno new evidence of faulty brakes. These considerations have led some researchers to consider \nhos to embed default reasoning within probability theory or utility theory.\n\nexplain",

Recruitment process should be scrutinized to give offers for the deserving candidates rather know candidates or friends. Every role should at least have one backup. For cws work transition, there shouldn't be just one employee to manage cooperate website, when he left, It is risky to just transfer to someone who never had experience with within a month. And in the end, will at least need to regain the experience that the previous employee had. No onward career path for my particular skillset. The career plan is rather vague. Following successive demergers there is a lack of clarity over what my role will be. Recognise i need to move on, as role in London is temporary - appreciate no action that can be taken to change this rating. Stop promoting people who are not capable only because their tenure at the company is long. This should be taken seriously. Some people don't deserve their titles. People managers should undergo rigorous assessment about leadership and relevant skills. Some people who are knowledgeable and have expertise in their field should not be promoted if they can't demonstrate this essential skill. This has and will severely affect the performance and professional growth of their subordinates. Many people who lack motivation and skills remain in high-position roles. for the SE position, my salary is almost the same as the salary for the E position where the job responsibilities are not the same. same issue: opportunity to be promoted. i find that the role of the recruiter-trainer for agencies is not supported enough by my direct hierarchy and even by the top management. My role seems to be not well understood. No, because every department is trying to develop according to its own duties all the time. ask employee interest in which department /role then evaluate match their skill set before transfer to others department blindly causing so many good staff leave the company plan properly how many employee needed for each department some colleague resigned, should have new headcount for hiring.. Too many people leaving, too much work left in the hands of people who stay back and are eventually forced to leave because of stress and pressure. Manager tries best to support but no support seen from region yet on inbound mobility even though that's always discussed as an option. Cost control forces minimal expat hiring. It is often promised that if I do something new I will get a good chance but until now the promised opportunity is nothing. While we preach that we will consider internal candidates in filling up key roles, the company often goes out to the market and look for candidates instead. Do consider internal candidates if they are willing to step up. We should have a rule that all roles must be advertised internally for at least 2 to 4 weeks before an external candidate can be considered. more on the lack of HC experience by tribes, we hope that we have a ready set of buffer/pool of support from HR (e.g. a pool of contractual/or adhoc support team) to fill in temporarily in case of resignation. Since hiring for permanent pool will take time. my position have not much career enhancement in the department i'm working for as it need expertise. the topped is capped and there is no room for growth. also when opportunities arise they are given to other individuals or recruitment is done. Zero career discussions in my entire time at Prudential. So I'm responsible for my own career aspirations - fine, but then my focus is on external. Prudential needs to be proactive in order to stop people considering external as a first step. Was only informed when working do not follow job description and should be going above and beyond on covering all areas. Only thinking about our dept/function/role & not for overall company benefit. leave the bad things to be able to develop a career at Prudential. Again, given the uncertainty around job security and expectation of redundancies at Angel Court, it would be na\u00efve not to look for jobs elsewhere in some capacity. My role has been reducing and there has been limited transparency or clear communication as to why. The opportunities exist, but there is no clear plan. The top talents of the CIV did not benefit from the mobility opportunities. I suggest we pay attention to it. again, a lot of people has been functioning way above their pay grade and level because of the lack in manpower. hoping we can just give them the job officially rather than getting someone that they'll train to be their boss. there are business analysts, scrum master or project delivery leads that are functioning as the same level as managers (even senior managers) with just spec 2 level and salary grade... there are software developers function as technical leads (even at expert engineer levels). if they're doing good at the job, why not just give them the job, hoping performance weights more than tenure and step ladders.",

        "prompt": "Summary this abstract:\n Abstract\nChemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a molecular imaging method which can noninvasively detect proteins/lipids and metabolites via exchangeable protons. It is able to detect the molecular changes in diseases, such as tumor, stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Currently, CEST MRI studies have been demonstrated mainly on high-field MRI scanners (\u22657T), where images with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be obtained. However, most of clinical MRI scanners are equipped with low field strengths (\u22643T). There are two major factors that hamper the translation of CEST MRI techniques to low field scanners (\u22643T). First, CEST effects are prone to be compromised by the scaling effects of magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) and direct water saturation (DS), especially when a high saturation power is applied. Second, the T1 relaxation time of tissues at low field is much shorter than that at high field, making CEST studies challenging at low field. To facilitate the translation of CEST MRI to clinical applications, it is necessary to develop new CEST MRI techniques at low field. In this thesis, we designed and established some advanced CEST MRI techniques that had high sensitivity and specificity at clinical field strength 3T and applied them to noninvasively detect neurological disorders, including AD and multiple sclerosis (MS). Our findings would promote the clinical applications of CEST MRI at 3T. This thesis was presented in the following three major aspects:\n\nFirst, we proposed an advanced dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) CEST MRI approach, named on-resonance variable delay multi-pulse (onVDMP), to simultaneously monitor natural D-glucose uptake and clearance in brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conventional DGE MRI only monitors the glucose signal in brain parenchyma, while our proposed method could additionally monitor the glucose signal in CSF. This could provide more information related to glymphatic system of brain. We then applied our DGE MRI method to study the glucose changes in AD mouse brain. We observed significantly higher uptake in parenchyma of young (6 months) transgenic AD mice (APP/PS1) compared to age-matched wild type (WT) mice (P = 0.007). Significantly lower uptakes were observed in parenchyma and CSF of old (16 months) AD mice (P = 0.035). Interestingly, both young and old AD mice had a significantly slower CSF clearance than age-matched WT mice (young: P = 0.017; old: P = 0.031). This resembles recent reports of the hampered CSF clearance that leads to protein accumulation in the brain. These findings suggest that DGE MRI can identify altered glucose uptake and clearance in young AD mice upon the emergency of amyloid plaques at clinical field strength 3T MRI. Based on these findings, we further developed a DGE MRI acquisition and post-processing scheme for sensitive monitoring glucose uptake and clearance in both brain parenchyma and CSF. By investigating Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence (CPMG), onVDMP and on-resonance spin-locking (onSL), a high-sensitivity DGE MRI scheme composed of CPMG method for monitoring parenchyma and onVDMP method for monitoring CSF was developed. We incorporated the multilinear singular value decomposition (MLSVD) based denoising method in post-processing, which enables the detection of DGE signals from the brain parenchyma and CSF at low concentration of D-glucose (12.5% w/w) injection.\n\nSecond, a deep neural network based CEST data processing method (CESTNet) was exploited to analyze the CEST data of mouse brains and promising results have been achieved. CEST data processing usually requires expert knowledge and the outcomes are diverse when different processing methods are applied. This could be challenging for non-CEST expert, e.g. clinicians and physicists. Moreover, we first time proposed to utilize deep neural network to generate apparent exchange-dependent relaxation (AREX) results (AREXNet). Previous studies have shown that AREX provides CEST signal with less influence of longitudinal relaxation (R1 = 1/T1). After optimization and training on CEST data of wild type (WT) mouse brains, CESTNet/AREXNet could rapidly (~1s) generate accurate CEST/AREX results for unseen CEST data of AD mouse brains, indicating the generalization of the networks for different CEST data. Significant lower amide proton transfer/magnetization transfer (APT/MT) signals related to amyloid beta-peptide (A\u03b2) plaque depositions, which were validated by immunohistochemistry results, were detected in AD mouse brains compared to WT mouse brains. The well-established CESTNet/AREXNet have great potential for AD identification at 3T clinical field strength MRI.\n\nThird, a pulsed-CEST MRI imaging scheme with low saturation powers (B1) and long mixing time (tmix) was established to rapidly acquire relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) weighted image with MTC suppression at 3T clinical field strength MRI. The MTC contributions were further reduced by subtracting the Z-spectral signals at two or three offsets by assuming the residual MTC is a linear function between -3.5 ppm and -12.5 ppm. Phantom studies of a lactic acid (Lac) solution mixed with cross-linked bovine serum albumin (BSA) show that strong MTC interference has significant impact on the optimum B1 for detecting rNOEs due to lactate binding. MTC could be effectively suppressed using a pulse train with a B1 of 0.8 \u03bcT, a pulse duration (tp) of 40 ms, a tmix of 60 ms and a pulse number (N) of 30, while rNOE signal was well maintained. As a proof-of-concept, we applied the method in mouse brain with injected hydrogel and a cell-hydrogel phantom. Results showed that rNOE weighted images could provide good contrast between brain/cell and hydrogel. Finally, we applied our optimized rNOEw imaging scheme to study the pathology changes regarding myelin lipid/protein in human brain with MS and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) on a clinical 3T MRI scanner. We found that rNOE signal of MS brains was significantly lower than that of NMOSD and healthy brains. Our rNOEw imaging scheme has great potential to assist MS diagnosis and specifically differentiate MS patients from NMOSD patients.",

        "prompt": "1) Brand name meaning\nAdman is French. It means see you tomorrow. It means to look forward to new changes with excitement, looking forward to tomorrow as well as today.\n\n2) Start-up opportunity\nCEO Kim Yong-hyeok (born in 1990) graduated from the Department of Venture Management at Seoul National University. Since he was in college, he has been interested in entrepreneurship. While working for a company (working at SK Planet in service planning and strategic planning), he thought that it would be impossible to start a business unless it was now, so he quit writing for the company. He first started with a brand business and is now preparing for several businesses.\n\n3) Growth history\nIn January 2023, skincare brand \u2018A\u2019demang\u2019 joined hands with beauty creator \u2018Arang\u2019, which has 350,000 subscribers, to conduct \u2018live broadcasting (Labang)\u2019 on YouTube. In particular, the 'Arang X Adman Encore 2nd Market' package products, which can only be met during this collaboration period, are organized and introduced, and the purchase certification, review posting events, etc. are held to attract viewers' response, while the chat window in Labang displays purchase certification. and product-related inquiries continued uninterrupted.\nIn fact, 20,000 viewers flocked to this Labang in one day, and from 7 pm on the day of the broadcast to the next day (29 hours in total), sales exceeded 150 million won, so it was a box office success. This is an achievement achieved in just three weeks after building a D2C (Direct to Consumer) shopping mall.\n\n4) Product/Brand Introduction\nArdman's first product is a toner pad. It was born with the meaning of creating a skin that is expected every day. People need care not only for their skin type but also for their skin condition. Therefore, it was produced with the intention of conditioning the skin that is suitable for oneself by considering the condition of the skin.\n\n5) Product/Brand Differentiation\nThe difference between toner pads is that they are large, soft in texture, and contain a lot of essence. The larger size was made in response to the opinions of consumers who use toner pads instead of packs. Normally, 2-3 toner pads are used to use as a pack, but one Aardman product is sufficient.\n\nToner pad and ampoule products have been vegan certified. Both products use Houttuynia cordata ingredients to have soothing and moisturizing effects, and received a green rating from the EWG, an American non-profit environmental research organization, which certifies that they have the lowest harmful ingredients, and were recognized as free from harmful ingredients by the beauty platform Hwahae.\n\nAlso, Ardman's cosmetics use a lot of good raw materials even if the cost is high. For example, purified water was not used in the ampoule.\n\n6) Sales (Marketing) Strategy\nCollaborate with multiple creators to launch products. The first collaboration was with Arang Creator. In addition, we plan to collaborate with several mega influencers. The reason I work with creators is because they are experts. For example, Arang is the best expert in cosmetics. Arang clearly pointed out what kind of needs there are when developing products and what elements need to be developed to meet those needs.\n\n11) Reasons for choosing Cafe24\nAfter doing online business centered on open markets such as Smart Store and Coupang, they built D2C (own mall) 2-3 weeks ago. The strength of jasamol becomes a real customer when consumers buy. When selling on other platforms, consumers stop buying products, but in D2C, it is possible to provide customized benefits or services according to the customer's inclination. Therefore, it is expected that sales can be increased through D2C.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30",

The new design goes heavy on imagery and vertical scrolling, turning your homescreen from a set of album covers into a feed that much more closely resembles TikTok and Instagram. As you scroll, Spotify is also hoping to make it easier to discover new things across the Spotify ecosystem.\n\nThe new look, which Spotify just announced at its Stream On event, is clear evidence of the kind of company (and product) Spotify wants to be. Over the last few years, it has invested heavily into podcasts, audiobooks, live audio, and more, all in an attempt to be more than just a music app. The company also wants to be a home for creators: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told The Verge in 2021 that he hoped to have more than 50 million \u201caudio creators\u201d on the platform. Spotify has also pushed for years to make video podcasts happen and is now largely watching as YouTube pulls it off.\n\nPut it all together, and that\u2019s a lot of things to shove into a single app called Spotify. Spotify has been on a seemingly relentless quest to nudge people toward content that\u2019s more differentiated and more profitable, which often meant making it harder to listen to music. That\u2019s why the app\u2019s new design seems to be in part meant to create more dedicated space for all those new kinds of content. Spotify has for years tried to find ways to put podcasts and music and everything else side by side but seems to be recognizing that the best answer is to give each thing more space to breathe.\n\nPodcast discovery in particular is crucial for Spotify to get right.\nImage: Spotify\nGoing forward, when you open Spotify, you\u2019ll still see a bunch of album and playlist covers at the top. But underneath, you might see an autoplaying video podcast, which you can jump into with a tap. Or you might see a big, Instagram-style photo meant to tell you a little more about a playlist you might like.\n\nIf you tap on \u201cMusic\u201d or \u201cPodcasts & Shows,\u201d you\u2019ll be taken into a vertically scrolling feed that looks more like Instagram Stories or TikTok\n\nAt the top, if you tap on \u201cMusic\u201d or \u201cPodcasts & Shows,\u201d you\u2019ll be taken into a vertically scrolling feed that looks a lot more like Instagram Stories or TikTok than the Spotify you\u2019re used to, dedicated to just that section of Spotify. You can flip through as many as you like, each one autoplaying to give you a sense of what it is, or tap on one to dive in and save or explore it further.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious tension in the design, between Spotify wanting to make the app a calmer and more navigable space while also trying to find new ways to entice people into new things. There\u2019s more autoplaying content than ever in the app now and lots of ways to quickly preview songs and playlists without hitting fully diving in. Full-screen vertical scrolling is everywhere now and is an obviously useful tool for discovery. Billions of users are used to swiping through a dozen things they don\u2019t like before landing on one they do. And in this new look, every song or playlist or podcast gets a momentary extra chance to grab you.\n\nPlaylists have been Spotify\u2019s main \u2014 and, for all intents and purposes, only \u2014 source of discovery, but in the new design, there\u2019s a much greater emphasis on getting you into new things. That makes particular sense in podcasts, where Spotify desperately needs to find ways to recoup its huge investments in the space. Ek may have admitted he made a mistake in betting so big on new kinds of audio, and the company has scaled back its team in the space, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s slowing down.\n\nThe other new thing you may notice in Spotify is more personalized AI. The Smart Shuffle feature, which temporarily adds tracks to your existing playlists, is supposedly an improvement on the \u201cjust for you playlist\u201d idea Spotify has been working on for years \u2014 and don\u2019t forget DJ, the AI spinning records and hosting your own personal radio show.\n\nSpotify is the biggest player in music streaming but continues to want to own audio in an even bigger way. That\u2019s what the new design really shows: that Spotify is no longer a music app and shouldn\u2019t look like one \u2014 and, hopefully, not look like a mish-mash-y mess of content, either.",

She had been without complaints for 5 years, but for the last 6 months she has been experiencing frequent dizziness when changing body position, tingling in the left arm, and complains of pain in her back. Numerous medical documents are available.\n\nUltrasound of the neck blood vessels - stenosis of both ACI up to 50%.\nMRI of the brain - vascular encephalopathy.\nMRI of the lumbar spine - protrusion of L3-L4, LA-L5, L5-SI discs, osteophyte complex that impairs the dural sac and reduces neural foramina, and inflammatory changes in the anterior margin of the L2 and L3 vertebrae.\nMRI of the cervical spine - protrusion of C5-C6, C6-CT discs, osteophyte complex that impairs the ventral contour of the medulla, and reduces the neural foramina with osteogenic reduction.\nEMNG - moderately severe chronic lesion of bilateral CS, C6, C7 roots.\n\nClinical findings: the patient is experiencing trunk ataxia and is less mobile. Sensory ability is diminished. Symmetrical myotatic reflexes. No pathological reflexes. Stronger oscillations in Romberg's test. No nystagmus. Normal cranial nerves function. Tandem walking is difficult.\n\nThe clinical findings are worsening, and trunk ataxia predominates. The hypoplasia is causing some symptoms, but so is the vertebrogenic compression of the left vertebral artery - the left AV is 0.7 mm in images and the right is 4 mm (the physiological diameter is 4 mm) - because the vertebral artery is crucial for circulation in the cerebellum (balance software). Stenosis of both ACI up to 50% is causing some of the symptoms.\n\nDiagnosis: Sy. vertiginosum Insuff. VB Stenosis ACI bill. Sy, lumbosacrale Ataxia truncalis.\n\nRecommendations: Ambene amp. 2 ml i.m. - given in the office, Torecan tbl 1x1 before meals for 4 weeks + therapy as before. Decompression and manual therapy are indicated. Vascular surgeon follow-up. Follow-up with Dr. Sucevic, Neurologist.\"",

As shown in Fig. 1, we utilize\nAraBERT as a powerful architecture, which is pre-trained on billion of\nArabic words, to produce sentence embedding of each text description\nwithout having to learn. We reduce the dimension of the sentence\nvector to achieve consistency with its input shape by training a fully\nconnected layer to both generator and discriminator on DF-GAN. Mean-\nwhile, unlike the previous architectures [4,7,9], DF-GAN succeeds to\nsynthesize high-resolution text-matching and realistic images given text\ndescriptions with just one pair of a discriminator and generator. As we\nmentioned previously, the generator has two inputs, the noise vector,\nand the sentence vector. Furthermore, The dimension of the sentence\nvector is reduced into the generator by adding a fully connected layer.\nIn addition, this fully connected layer is trained inside the architecture\nin a weakly supervised way, which means the parameter of the layer\nis updated during the back-propagation phase. Hence, As shown in\nFig. 1, we inject the reduced sentence vector on overall UPBlocks.\nThe UPBlock is composed of Upsample and two DFBlock. The DFBlock\nconsists of a series of Affine Transformations, ReLu Activation, Affine\nTransformation, another ReLu Activation, and a Convolution Layer. We\nclearly present in Fig. 2 the process of fusing sentence vector and image\nfeatures in DFBlock. In addition, the Affine Transformation process is\ndetailed in DF-GAN section. Furthermore, the reduced sentence vector\nis concatenated with image features into DownBlock in order to com-\npute adversarial loss and evaluate the visual and semantic consistency\nof inputs. Our architecture demonstrates the capability to generate\nhigh-resolution, text-matching, and realistic images given Arabic text\ndescriptions.",

It becomes a great challenge these days to preserve our flora and fauna by controlling various unexpected pollution activities. Although the invention of many schemes and programmes regarding water purification has done a tremendous job, but still there is something that has been lagging. With increase in population, industrialization and global warming situation is getting worse day by day. It becomes very difficult to get safe drinking water and appropriate quality water for other domestic usage and agriculture purpose. Major reasons for water pollution include undesirable increase in impurities. These may cause eutrophication of the water body, change in taste, discolouration and odour of water, water borne diseases, increase in water toxic nature etc. For water to be serviceable it should be aesthetically acceptable, chemically safe, bacteria free; organic substances and radioactive elements should be absent. So, there is an urgent need to look into this situation and take the corrective and necessary actions to overcome this situation. The government is paying an attention to this problem and finding the ways to control the situation. However, major areas are not developed to the point and water quality estimation is totally dependent upon sampling at location and testing in laboratories. Manual sampling and measurements are prone to human errors and these techniques may create ambiguities in predicted output. In this paper we have presented Machine Learning (ML) approach for calculating the Water Quality Index (WQI) and classification of water quality to estimate water characteristics for usage. For analysis, decision tree method is used to estimate water quality information. The standard values of parameters are selected as per guidelines provided by World Health organization (WHO). Results calculated using ML techniques showed prominent accuracy over traditional methods. Accuracy achieved is also significant, i.e. 98 %. Likewise, projection of gathered data was done utilizing web interface and web app to alert the authorities about contamination.",
